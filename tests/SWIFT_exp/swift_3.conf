sites: [stampede, gordon]
    # This config variant uses Swift's site scoring mechanism to probe
    # the two different sites with tasks and have the site with higher score
    # be allocated more tasks.
    # This is done by removing the maxParallelTasks and initialParallelTasks
    # attributes which were set to override this site scoring logic

# Instructions for Stampede
# 1. If you are running on the midway login nodes set jobManager: "local:slurm"
# 2. Set workDirectory to /tmp/your_username_on_stampede
