*** Fixed data channel reuse behavior

(02/11/2008)

*** The last commit broke things (mlst seems picky).

(02/01/2008)

*** Missed some spots on the data channel reuse.

(12/03/2007)

*** Added data channel reuse mode for GridFTP if the server
    version is 2.3. Presumably more versions support this and
    they should eventually be added.

(10/30/2007)

*** Added totalSize implementation to data sources such that 
    the JGlobus GridFTP client sends the ALLO command before
    a transfer.

(10/03/2007)

*** Fixed some issues with the credentials used for the callback
    handler.

(08/20/2007)

*** Updated to use the new redirection stuff

(08/10/2007)

*** Removed a puzzling thing. Seems like most put/get methods in
    the file resource would ask the for the current directory only
    to not use it at all.

(05/18/2007)

*** Updated delegation bits

(03/07/2007)

*** Increased GridFTP default timeout from 12s to 30s

(02/23/2007)

*** Fixed:

*** There was some useless parse(rsl) call, since the rsl was
    constructed using the RSL API in JGlobus, so it should have
	been correct in the first place.


(02/06/2007)

*** The job task handler now shuts down callback handlers from 
    JGlobus if they have no more registered jobs.

(01/28/2006)

*** Updated file resource exceptions

-------------------------------2.3----------------------------------

(11/28/2006)

*** Cleaned up the file resource implementations

(10/18/2006)

*** Added a mkdirs implementation for the file resource

(10/09/2006)

*** Use JGlobus RSL classes to construct the RSL in a structured way. 
	This does proper quoting and possibly eliminates other errors.

(10/06/2006)

*** Use textual GRAM messages instead of the error code

(04/12/2006)

*** Limited delegation is now the default

(11/23/2005)

*** Fixed a bug regarding the current dir being GridFile.UNKNOWN instead of
    GridFile.DIRECTORY. Thanks to David Del Vecchio
	
*** Added a gridftp specific security context, which allows controlling
    dcau and protection parameters.

-------------------------------2.2----------------------------------

(08/11/2005)

*** Added support for MPICH-G2 job submissions and mutli-job 
    rsl in 
    org.globus.cog.abstraction.impl.execution.gt2.JobSubmissionTaskHandler.java


(06/14/2005)

*** Fixed the GridFTP provider to do recursive deleletes with 
    GridFTP v2.0 server.
    http://www.cogkit.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=152
	
-------------------------------2.1----------------------------------

(06/10/2005)

*** Split into new and old gridftp providers. The new one should work with
    post gt3.2 servers. The old one does not work with servers from gt4.
			
*** Re-implemented isDirectory in the new gridftp file resource. The old one
    was doing a cwd to check if a file was a directory. The new one does a
    mlst(), and checks the returned file type. It's twice as fast.

(06/08/2005)

*** Added support for FORK and PBS JobManagers in
    org.globus.cog.abstraction.impl.execution.gt2.JobSubmissionTaskHandler.java

(05/24/2005)

*** Added support for environment variables in
    org.globus.cog.abstraction.impl.execution.gt2.JobSubmissionTaskHandler.java

(04/18/2005)

*** Renamed the module from "core-provider-gt2" to 
    "provider-gt2"
	
-------------------------------2.0----------------------------------

-------------------------------1.1----------------------------------

(03/29/2005)

*** If no IP can be figured out from CoGProperties, throw an 
    exception 

(03/24/2005)

*** Updated the implementation of 
    org.globus.cog.core.impl.file.ftp.FileResourceImpl.java 
     and 
    org.globus.cog.core.impl.file.gridftp.FileResourceImpl.java 
    to make them compatible with the changes in their 
    interface

(03/17/2005)

*** Updated the FTPSecurityCredentialImpl to show a dialog box 
    prompting the user to enter credentials (if null
    credentials are specified)   

-------------------------------1.0----------------------------------
