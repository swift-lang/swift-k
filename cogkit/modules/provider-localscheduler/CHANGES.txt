*** Added prototype SGE provider

*** Added handling of multi jobs using ssh

(06/25/09)

*** Held condor jobs are treated as failures if the heldIsFailure attribute
    is set to true.

(04/15/09)

*** Support for Condor-G submissions, by setting a job specification attribute
    of "grid" and specifying a gridResource attribute containing the string
    to be placed into the Condor-G grid_resource classad.

(03/13/09)

*** Refactored common portions of providers into abstract parts

*** Added condor provider

(04/24/08)

*** Added job canceling to PBS

(09/19/07)

*** Cobalt: 'count' attribute mapped to '-c'. The default should
    be figured by cqsub from 'hostCount'. Looking at the cqsub
    code, it seems like count = 2 * hostCount on a BG/L and
    count = 4 * hostCount on a BG/P. That's in vn mode. In
    co mode count = hostCount.

*** Cobalt: 'hostCount' attribute mapped to '-n', with a default
    of 1

(08/22/07)

*** The cobalt provider was not passing command line arguments
    to the job
    
*** Added -k <kernel profile> option for cobalt. The spec attribute
    is "kernelprofile".
    
*** Configurable exit code extraction regexps (Kevin Harms points
    out that looking for a string containing "BG/L job exit status"
    is likely to not work on a BG/P). D'oh!

(08/20/07)

*** Redirection updates

(02/27/07)

*** I think Process.waitFor() can deadlock if there's too
    much stuff on std*. The processing of stdout from qstat
	is now done while the qstat process is running.

(02/14/07)

*** Fixed Cobalt

(02/12/07)

*** Initial version
