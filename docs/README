Prerequisites to building documentation:

* asciidoc and a2x (http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc)
* dblatex (http://dblatex.sourceforge.net)
* source-highlight (http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite)

For CI users, compiled versions of these packages can be found in ~davidk.

Note that asciidoc requires Python between 2.4 and 2.7
Python 3.2 must not be the python in your PATH
