== Collective Data Management

=== Description

Collective Data Management (CDM) is a set of optimizations in Swift to
improve data access patterns by Swift.  In particular, it can be used
to avoid data staging (extra file copies) on an HPC system or cluster
with a shared file system.

=== Usage Overview

. The user specifies a CDM policy in a file, customarily +fs.data+.
. +fs.data+ is given to Swift on the command line.
. The Swift data module is informed of the CDM policy.
. At job launch time, for each file, the Swift mechanics query the CDM file,
   .. altering the file staging phase, and
   .. sending +fs.data+ to the compute site.
. At job run time, the Swift wrapper script
   .. consults a Perl script to obtain policy from +fs.data+, and
   .. uses wrapper extensions to modify data movement.
. Similarly, stage out can be changed.

.Command line
-----
$ swift -sites.file sites.xml -tc.file tc.data -cdm.file fs.data stream.swift
-----

=== CDM policy file format
A CDM policy file contains four space separated fields as follows:
. The keyword 'rule'
. The filename pattern expressed as a regexp
. The rulename: DIRECT, GATHER, BROADCAST etc.
. The path where to look for the files (optional)

==== Example
-----
# Describe CDM for my job
property GATHER_LIMIT 1
rule .*input.txt DIRECT /gpfs/homes/wozniak/data
rule .*xfile*.data BROADCAST /dev/shm
rule .* DEFAULT
-----

The lines contain:

. A directive, either +rule+ or +property+.
. A rule has:
   .. A regular expression to match on the file name.
   .. A policy token.
   .. Additional policy-specific arguments.
. A property has:
   .. A policy property token.
   .. The token value.
. Comments with +#+.
. Blank lines are ignored.

==== Notes

. The policy file is used as a lookup database by Swift and Perl
methods.  Thus, one should only use basic features such as +.*+ .
. Swift treats file names as URLs, while the wrapper script treats
them as Unix file names.  Thus, one should use a wildcard in the
beginning of each file name, as shown in the example.
. For example, a lookup with the database above given the argument
+input.txt+ would result in the +DIRECT+ policy.
. Each rule is considered in the order given; the first match results
in that policy line.
. If the lookup does not succeed, the result is +DEFAULT+.

=== Policy Descriptions
==== DEFAULT

* Just use file staging as provided by Swift.
Identical to behavior if no CDM file is given.

==== DIRECT
-----
rule .*input.txt DIRECT /gpfs/scratch/wozniak/
-----
* Allows for direct I/O to the parallel FS without staging.
* The input files matching the pattern must already exist in the
given directory, a shared file system location.
Links will be placed in the job directory.
* The output files matching the pattern will be stored in the given
directory, with links in the job directory.
* Example: In the rule above, the Swift-generated file name
+./data/input.txt+ would be accessed by the user job in
+/gpfs/homes/wozniak/data/input.txt+ .

==== LOCAL
-----
rule .*input.txt LOCAL dd /gpfs/homes/user/data obs=64K
-----
* Allows for client-directed input copy to the compute node.
* The user may specify +cp+ or +dd+ as the input transfer program.
* The input files matching the pattern must already exist in the
given directory, a shared file system location.
Copies will be placed in the job directory for use by the user job.
* Argument list: [tool] [directory] [tool arguments]*

=== Specific use cases

==== Matching on all file names

To match all file names produced by Swift, simply use pattern +.*+

A common use case is to redirect all file operations to a given
directory, say, +/fs/dir+.  To do this, use a rule such as:

----
rule .* DIRECT /fs/dir
----

==== Absolute paths

If your Swift script operates on files with absolute path names such as:

----
file f<"/fs/dir/f.txt">;
----

use:

----
rule .*f.txt DIRECT /
----

==== Use of symbolic links

Swift may provide a symbolic link to the application, which the
application may read and write normally.  The application may not
unlink these links; if it does, the application will not be able to
find or create Swift-compatible data.

=== Debugging

To troubleshoot CDM, check the Swift log and the wrapper logs
(+*-info+ files).  These will indicate the CDM policy that Swift finds
for each file and resulting action, such as skipping stage in for
DIRECT and the creation of links.  Common errors include specifying
the wrong directory which will result in an error that the file was
not found, or that a link could not be created.

// .Gather
// -----
// property GATHER_LIMIT 500000000 # 500 MB
// property GATHER_DIR /dev/shm/gather
// property GATHER_TARGET /gpfs/wozniak/data/gather_target
// rule .*.output.txt GATHER
// -----

// * The output files matching the pattern will be present to tasks in the job directory as usual but noted in a _swiftwrap shell array GATHER_OUTPUT.
// * The GATHER_OUTPUT files will be cached in the GATHER_DIR, an LFS location.
// * The cache will be flushed when a job ends if a du on GATHER_DIR exceeds GATHER_LIMIT.
// * As the cache fills or on stage out, the files will be bundled into randomly named tarballs in GATHER_TARGET, a GFS location.
// * If the compute node is an SMP, GATHER_DIR is a shared resource.  It is protected by the link file GATHER_DIR/.cdm.lock .
// * Unpacking the tarballs in GATHER_TARGET will produce the user-specified filenames.

// .Summary

// . Files created by application
// . Acquire lock
// . Move files to cache
// . Check cache size
// . If limit exceeded, move all cache files to outbox
// . Release lock
// . If limit was exceeded, stream outbox as tarball to target

// .Notes

// * Gather required quite a bit of shell functionality to manage the lock, etc. This is placed in cdm_lib.sh .
// * vdl_int.k needed an additional task submission (cdm_cleanup.sh) to perform the final flush at workflow completion time .  This task also uses cdm_lib.sh .


// VDL/Karajan processing
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// . CDM functions are available in Karajan via the cdm namespace.
// . These functions are defined in org.globus.swift.data.Query .
// . If CDM is enabled, VDL skips file staging for files unless the policy is DEFAULT.


// Swift wrapper CDM routines
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// . The cdm.pl script is shipped to the compute node if CDM is enabled.
// . When linking in inputs, CDM is consulted by _swiftwrap:cdm_lookup().
// . The cdm_action() shell function handles CDM methods, typically just producing a link.


// Test cases
// ~~~~~~~~~~

// . Simple test cases are in:
//       https://svn.mcs.anl.gov/repos/wozniak/collab/cdm/scripts/cdm-direct and
//       https://svn.mcs.anl.gov/repos/wozniak/collab/cdm/scripts/all-pairs
// . Do a:
//       mkdir cdm
//       cd cdm
//       svn co https://svn.mcs.anl.gov/repos/wozniak/collab/cdm/scripts
// . In cdm-direct, run:
//       source ./setup.sh local local local
// . Run workflow:
//       swift -sites.file sites.xml -tc.file tc.data -cdm.file fs.data stream.swift
// . Note that staging is skipped for input.txt
//       policy: file://localhost/input.txt : DIRECT
//       FILE_STAGE_IN_START file=input.txt ...
//       FILE_STAGE_IN_SKIP file=input.txt policy=DIRECT
//       FILE_STAGE_IN_END file=input.txt ...
// . In the wrapper output, the input file is handled by CDM functionality:
//       Progress  2010-01-21 13:50:32.466572727-0600  LINK_INPUTS
//       CDM_POLICY: DIRECT /homes/wozniak/cdm/scripts/cdm-direct
//       CDM: jobs/t/cp_sh-tkul4nmj input.txt DIRECT /homes/wozniak/cdm/scripts/cdm-direct
//       CDM[DIRECT]: Linking jobs/t/cp_sh-tkul4nmj/input.txt to /homes/wozniak/cdm/scripts/cdm-direct/input.txt
//       Progress  2010-01-21 13:50:32.486016708-0600  EXECUTE
// . all-pairs is quite similar but uses more policies.


// PTMap case
// ^^^^^^^^^^
// . Start with vanilla PTMap:
//    .. cd cdm
//    .. mkdir apps
//    .. cd apps
//    .. https://svn.mcs.anl.gov/repos/wozniak/collab/cdm/apps/ptmap
// . Source setup.sh
// . Use start.sh, which
//    .. applies CDM policy from fs.local.data


// CDM site-aware policy file format
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

// Example

// -----
// #Describe CDM for my job
// #Use DIRECT and BROADCAST if on cluster1, else use DEFAULT behavior
// property GATHER_LIMIT 1
// rule cluster1 .*input.txt DIRECT /gpfs/homes/wozniak/data
// rule cluster1 .*xfile*.data BROADCAST /dev/shm
// rule ANYWHERE .* DEFAULT
// -----

// The lines contain:

// . A directive, either rule or property
// . A rule has:
//    .. A regular expression for site matching
//    .. A regular expression for filename matching
//    .. A policy token
//    .. Additional policy-specific arguments
// . A property has
//    .. A policy property token
//    .. The token value
// . Comments with # .
// . Blank lines are ignored.
