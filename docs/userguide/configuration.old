Configuration
-------------

Swift uses a single configuration file called swift.properties. The swift.properties 
file is responsible for:

1. Defining how to interface with schedulers
2. Defining app names and locations
3. Defining various other swift settings and behavior

Here is an example swift.properties file.

-----
# Define a site named sandyb
site.sandyb {
   tasksPerWorker=16
   taskWalltime=00:05:00
   jobManager=slurm
   jobQueue=sandyb
   maxJobs=1
   workdir=/scratch/midway/$USER/work
   filesystem=local
}

# Define sandyb apps
app.sandyb.echo=/bin/echo

# Define other swift properties
sitedir.keep=true
wrapperlog.always.transfer=true

# Select which site to run on
site=sandyb
-----

The details of this file will be explained more later. Let's first look 
at an example of running Swift. Using the swift.properties the new Swift 
command a user would run is:

-----
$ swift script.swift
-----

That is all that is needed. Everything Swift needs to know is defined in
swift.properties.

Location of swift.properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Swift searches for swift.properties files in multiple locations:

1. The etc/swift.properties file included with the Swift distribution.
2. $SWIFT_SITE_CONF/swift.properties - used for defining site templates.
3. $HOME/.swift/swift.properties
4. swift.properties in your current directory.
5. Any property file you point to with the command line argument "-properties
<file>"

Settings get read in this order. Definitions in the later files will override
any previous definitions. For example, if you have execution.retries=10 in
$HOME/.swift/swift.properties, and execution.retries=0 in the swift.properties
in your current directory, execution.retries will be set to 0.

To verify what files are being read, and what values will be set, run:
-----
$ swift -listconfig
-----

Selecting a site
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are two ways Swift knows where to run. The first is via
swift.properties. The site command specified which site entries
should be used for a particular run. 

-----
site=sandyb
-----

Sites can also be selected on the command line by using the -site option.

-----
$ swift -site westmere script.swift
-----

The -site command line argument will override any sites selected in
swift.properties.

Selecting multiple sites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To use multiple sites, use a list of site names separated by commas. In
swift.properties:

-----
site=westmere,sandyb
-----

The same format can be used on the command line:

-----
$ swift -site westmere,sandyb script.swift
-----

NOTE: You can also use "sites=" in swift.properties, and "-sites x,y,z" on the
command line.

Run directories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you run Swift, you will see a run directory get created. The run
directory has the name of runNNN, where NNN starts at 000 and increments for
every run.

The run directories can be useful for debugging. They contain:
.Run directory contents
|======================
|apps     |An apps generated from swift.properties
|cf       |A configuration file generated from swift.properties
|runNNN.log|The log file generated during the Swift run
|scriptname-runNNN.d|Debug directory containing wrapper logs
|scripts|Directory that contains scheduler scripts used for that run
|sites.xml|A sites.xml generated from swift.properties
|swift.out|The standard out and standard error generated by Swift
|======================

Using site templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Swift recognizes an environmnet variable called $SWIFT_SITE_CONF, which points to
a directory containing a swift.properties file. This swift.properties can contain multiple 
site definitions for the various queues available on the cluster you are using.

Your local swift.properties then does not need to define the entire site. It 
may contain only differences you need to make that are specific to your 
application, like walltime.

Backward compatability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
New users are encouraged to use the configuration mechanisms described in this documentation.
However, if you are migrating from an older Swift release to 0.95, the older-style configurations
using sites.xml and tc.data should still work. If you notice an instance where this is not true, 
please send an email to swift-support@ci.uchicago.edu.

The swift.properties file format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Site definitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Site definitions in the swift.properties files begin with "site".

The second word is the name of the site you are defining. In these examples we
will define a site called westmere.

The third word is the property.

For example:
-----
site.westmere.jobQueue=fast
-----

Before the site properties are listed, it's important to understand the
terminology used.

A *task*, or *app task* is an instance of a program as defined in
a Swift app() function.

A *worker* is the program that launches app tasks. 

A *job* is related to schedulers. It is the mechanism by which workers
are launched.

Below is the list of valid site properties with brief explanations of what 
they do, and an example swift.properties entry.

.swift.properties site properties
[options="header"]
|================================
|Property|Description|Example

|condor|
Pass parameters directly through to the submit script generated for the condor
scheduler. For example, the setting "site.osgconnect.condor.+projectname=Swift"
will generate the line "+projectname = Swift".
|site.osgconnect.condor.+projectname=Swift

|filesystem|
Defines how files should be accessed
|site.westmere.filesystem=local

|jobGranularity|
Specifies the granularity of a job, in nodes
|site.westmere.jobGranularity=2

|jobManager|
Specifies how jobs will be launched. The supported job managers are 
"cobalt", "slurm", "condor", "pbs", "lsf", "local", and "sge". 
|site.westmere.jobManager=slurm

|jobProject|
Set the project name for the job scheduler
|site.westmere.project=myproject

|jobQueue|
Set the name of the scheduler queue to use.
|site.westmere.jobQueue=westmere

|jobWalltime|
The maximum number amount of time allocated in a scheduler job, in hh:mm:ss
format.
|site.westmere.jobWalltime=01:00:00

|maxJobs|
Maximum number of scheduler jobs to submit
|site.westmere.maxJobs=20

|maxNodesPerJob|
The maximum number of nodes to request per scheduler job.
|site.westmere.maxNodesPerJob=2

|providerAttributes|
Allows user to pass attributes through directly to scheduler submit script. Currently
only implemented for sites that use PBS.
|site.beagle.providerAttributes=pbs.aprun;pbs.mpp;depth=24

|slurm|
Pass parameters directly through to the submit script generated for the slurm
scheduler. For example, the setting "site.midway.slurm.mail-user=username" generates
the line "#SBATCH --mail-user=username".

|taskDir|
Tasks will be run from this directory. In the absence of a taskDir definition, 
Swift will run the task from workdir.
|site.westmere.taskDir=/scratch/local/$USER/work

|tasksPerWorker|
The number of tasks that each worker can run simultaneously.
|site.westmere.tasksPernode=12

|taskThrottle|
The maximum number of active tasks across all workers.
|site.westmere.taskThrottle=100

|taskWalltime|
The maximum amount of time a task may run, in hh:mm:ss.
|site.westmere.taskWalltime=01:00:00

|site    |
Name of site or sites to run on. This is the same as running with
swift -site <sitename>
|site=westmere

|userHomeOverride|
Sets the Swift user home. This must be a shared filesystem. This defaults
to $HOME. For clusters where $HOME is not accessible to the worker nodes,
you may override the value to point to a shared directory that you own.
|site.beagle.userHomeOverride=/lustre/beagle/username

|workdir |
The workdirectory element specifies where on the site files can be stored.
This directory must be available on all worker nodes that will be used for 
execution. A shared cluster filesystem is appropriate for this. Note that 
you need to specify absolute pathname for this field.
|site.westmere.workdir=/scratch/midway/$USER/work

|================================

Grouping site properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The example swift.properties in this document listed the following site
related properties:

-----
site.westmere.provider=local:slurm
site.westmere.jobsPerNode=12
site.westmere.maxWalltime=00:05:00
site.westmere.queue=westmere
site.westmere.initialScore=10000
site.westmere.filesystem=local
site.westmere.workdir=/scratch/midway/davidkelly999
-----

However, you can also simplify this by grouping site properties together with
curly brackets.

------
site.westmere {
   provider=local:slurm
   jobsPerNode=12
   maxWalltime=00:05:00
   queue=westmere
   initialScore=10000
   filesystem=local
   workdir=/scratch/midway/$USER/work
}
-----

App definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In 0.95, applications wildcards will be used by default. This means that 
$PATH will be searched and pathnames to application do not have to be defined.

In the case where you have multiple sites defined, and you want
control over where things run, you will need to define the location of apps.
In this scenario, you will can define apps in swift.properties with something
like this:

-----
app.westmere.cat=/bin/cat
-----

When an app is defined in swift.properties for any site you are running on,
wildcards will be disabled, and all apps you want to use must be defined.

General Swift properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Swift behavior can be configured through general Swift properties. Below is a list of properties:

[options="header"]
|================
|Name|Valid Values|Default Value|Description

|config.rundirs
|true, false
|true
|By default, Swift will generate a run directory that contains logs, scheduler submit scripts,
|debug directories, and other files associated with a particular Swift run. Setting this value
|to false disables the creation of run directories and causes all logs and directories to be
|created in the current working directory.

|execution.retries
|Positive integer
|2
|The number of time a job will be retried if it fails (giving a
 maximum of 1 + execution.retries attempts at execution)

|foreach.max.threads
|Positive integer
|1024
|Limits the number of concurrent iterations that each foreach
 statement can have at one time. This conserves memory for swift
 programs that have large numbers of iterations (which would
 otherwise all be executed in parallel)

|lazy.errors
|true, false
|false
|Swift can report application errors in two modes, depending on the
 value of this property. If set to false, Swift will report the
 first error encountered and immediately stop execution. If set to
 true, Swift will attempt to run as much as possible from a
 Swift script before stopping execution and reporting all
 errors encountered. When developing Swift scripts, using the default value of
 false can make the program easier to debug. However in production
 runs, using true will allow more of a Swift script to be
 run before Swift aborts execution.

|swift.home
|String
|
|Points to the Swift installation directory ($SWIFT_HOME). In general, this should 
 not be set as Swift can find its own installation directory, and incorrectly setting it may impair the
 correct functionality of Swift.

|pgraph
|true, false
|false
|Swift can generate a Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/> file
representing the structure of the Swift script it has run. If
this property is set to true, Swift will save the provenance graph
in a file named by concatenating the program name and the instance
ID (e.g. helloworld-ht0adgi315l61.dot).
If set to false, no provenance graph will be generated. If a file
name is used, then the provenance graph will be saved in the
specified file.
The generated dot file can be rendered into a graphical form using
Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/>, for example with a command-line
such as:
$ swift -pgraph graph1.dot q1.swift
$ dot -ograph.png -Tpng graph1.dot

|pgraph.graph.options
|String
|splines="compound", rankdir="TB"
|This property specifies a Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org>
 specific set of parameters for the graph.

|pgraph.node.options
|String
|color="seagreen", style="filled"
|Used to specify a set of Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org> specific
 properties for the nodes in the graph.

|provenance.log
|true, false
|false
|This property controls whether the log file will contain provenance
 information enabling this will increase the size of log files,
 sometimes significantly.

|sitedir.keep
|true, false
|false
|Indicates whether the working directory on the remote site should be
 left intact even when a run completes successfully. This can be used
 to inspect the site working directory for debugging purposes.

|status.mode
|files, provider
|files
|Controls how Swift will communicate the result code of running user
 programs from workers to the submit side. In files mode, a file
 indicating success or failure will be created on the site shared
 filesystem. In provider mode, the execution provider job status
 will be used. provider mode requires the underlying job execution system to
 correctly return exit codes.

|tcp.port.range
|none
|<start>,<end> where start and end are integers
|A TCP port range can be specified to restrict the ports on which
 GRAM callback services are started. This is likely needed if your
 submit host is behind a firewall, in which case the firewall should
 be configured to allow incoming connections on ports in the range.

|throttle.file.operations
|<int>, off
|8
|Limits the total number of concurrent file operations that can
 happen at any given time. File operations (like transfers) require
 an exclusive connection to a site. These connections can be
 expensive to establish. A large number of concurrent file operations
 may cause Swift to attempt to establish many such expensive
 connections to various sites. Limiting the number of concurrent file
 operations causes Swift to use a small number of cached connections
 and achieve better overall performance.

|throttle.host.submit
|<int>, off
|2
|Limits the number of concurrent submissions for any of the sites
 Swift will try to send jobs to. In other words it guarantees that no
 more than the value of this throttle jobs sent to any site will be
 concurrently in a state of being submitted.

|throttle.score.job.factor
|<int>, off
|4
|The Swift scheduler has the ability to limit the number of
concurrent jobs allowed on a site based on the performance history
of that site. Each site is assigned a score (initially 1), which can
increase or decrease based on whether the site yields successful or
faulty job runs. The score for a site can take values in the (0.1,
100) interval. The number of allowed jobs is calculated using the
following formula:
2 + score*throttle.score.job.factor
This means a site will always be allowed at least two concurrent
jobs and at most 2 + 100*throttle.score.job.factor. With a default
of 4 this means at least 2 jobs and at most 402.
This parameter can also be set per site using the jobThrottle
profile key in a site catalog entry.

|throttle.submit
|<int>, off
|4
|Limits the number of concurrent submissions for a run. This throttle
 only limits the number of concurrent tasks (jobs) that are being
 sent to sites, not the total number of concurrent jobs that can be
 run. The submission stage in GRAM is one of the most CPU expensive
 stages (due mostly to the mutual authentication and delegation).
 Having too many concurrent submissions can overload either or both
 the submit host CPU and the remote host/head node causing degraded
 performance.

|throttle.transfers
|<int>, off
|4
|Limits the total number of concurrent file transfers that can happen
 at any given time. File transfers consume bandwidth. Too many
 concurrent transfers can cause the network to be overloaded
 preventing various other signaling traffic from flowing properly.

|ticker.disable
|true, false
|false
|When set to true, suppresses the output progress ticker that Swift
 sends to the console every few seconds during a run

|use.wrapper.staging
|true, false
|false
|Determines if the Swift wrapper should do file staging.

|wrapper.invocation.mode
|absolute, relative
|absolute
|Determines if Swift remote wrappers will be executed by specifying
 an absolute path, or a path relative to the job initial working
 directory. In most cases, execution will be successful with either
 option. However, some execution sites ignore the specified initial
 working directory, and so absolute must be used. Conversely on
 some sites, job directories appear in a different place on the
 worker node file system than on the filesystem access node, with the
 execution system handling translation of the job initial working
 directory. In such cases, relative mode must be used.

|wrapper.parameter.mode
|args,files
|args
|Controls how Swift will supply parameters to the remote wrapper
 script. args mode will pass parameters on the command line. Some
 execution systems do not pass commandline parameters sufficiently
 cleanly for Swift to operate correctly. files mode will pass
 parameters through an additional input file. This
 provides a cleaner communication channel for parameters, at the
 expense of transferring an additional file for each job invocation.

|wrapperlog.always.transfer
|true, false
|false
|This property controls when output from the Swift remote wrapper is
 transfered back to the submit site. When set to false, wrapper
 logs are only transfered for jobs that fail. If set to true,
 wrapper logs are transfered after every job is completed or failed.

|================


Using shell variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Any value in swift.properties may contain environment variables. For example:

-----
workdir=/scratch/midway/$USER/work
----

Environment variables are expanded locally on the machine where you are running
Swift.

Swift will also define a variable called $RUNDIRECTORY that is the path to the 
run directory Swift creates. In a case where you'd like your work directory
to be in the runNNN directory, you may do something like this:

-----
workdir=$RUNDIRECTORY
-----
