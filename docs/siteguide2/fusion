Fusion (x86 cluster)
-------------------

Fusion is a 320-node computing cluster for the Argonne's Laboratory Computing
Resource Center (LCRC). The primary goal of the LCRC is to facilitate mid-range
computing in all of the scientific programs of Argonne and the University of
Chicago.

This section will walk you through running a simple Swift script
on Fusion.

Requesting Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you do not already have a Fusion account, you can request one at
https://accounts.lcrc.anl.gov/request.php. Email support@lcrc.anl.gov
for additional help.

Projects
~~~~~~~~
In order to run a job on a Fusion compute node, you must first be associated
with a project.

Each project has one or more Primary Investigators, or PIs. These PIs are
responsible for adding and removing users to a project. Contact the PI of
your project to be added.

More information on this process can be found at
http://www.lcrc.anl.gov/info/Projects.

SSH Keys
~~~~~~~~
Before accessing Fusion, be sure to have your SSH keys configured correctly.
SSH keys are required to access fusion. You should see information about this
when you request your account. Check
link:http://wiki.mcs.anl.gov/IT/index.php/SSH_keys[ssh FAQ] or email
support@lcrc.anl.gov for additional help.

Connecting to a login node
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once your keys are configured, you should be able to access a Fusion login
node with the following command:

-----
ssh <yourusername>@fusion.lcrc.anl.gov
-----

Creating sites.xml
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Swift uses various configuration files to determine how to
run an application. This section will provide a working configuration file which
you can copy and paste to get running quickly. The sites.xml file
tells Swift how to submit jobs, where working directories are
located, and various other configuration information. More
information on sites.xml can be found in the Swift link:http://swiftlang.org/docs/index.php[documentation].

The first step is to paste the text below into a file named sites.xml.

-----
include::../../tests/providers/fusion/coasters/sites.template.xml[]
-----

This file will require one customization. Create a
directory called swiftwork. Modify \_WORK_ in sites.xml
to point to a new directory. For example

-----
<workdirectory>/tmp/swiftwork</workdirectory>
-----

Creating tc
~~~~~~~~~~~
The tc configuration file gives information about the applications
that will be called by Swift. More information about the format
of tc can be found in the Swift user guide.

Paste the following example into a file named tc

-----
include::../../tests/providers/fusion/coasters/tc.template.data[]
-----

Copy a Swift Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Within the Swift directory is an examples directory which contains several
introductory Swift scripts. The example we will use in this section is called
catsn.swift. The script copies input file's content to another file using the
Unix cat utility. Copy this script to the same directory that your sites.xml
and tc.data files are located.

-----
$ cp ~/swift/examples/misc/catsn.swift .
$ cp ~/swift/examples/misc/data.txt .
-----

TIP: The location of your swift directory may vary depending on how you
installed it. Change this to the examples/misc directory of your installation
as needed.

Run Swift
~~~~~~~~~
Finally, run the script
-----
$ swift -sites.file sites.xml -tc.file tc catsn.swift
-----

You should see 10 new text files get created, named catsn*.out. If
you see these files, then you have succesfully run Swift on Fusion!

Queues
~~~~~~
Fusion has two queues: shared and batch. The shared queue has a maximum 1
hour walltime and limited to 4 nodes. The batch queue is for all other
jobs.

Edit your sites.xml file and edit the queue option to modify Swift's
behavior. For example:

-----
<profile namespace="globus" key="queue">batch</profile>
-----

More information on Fusion queues can be found at
http://www.lcrc.anl.gov/info/BatchJobs.

More Help
~~~~~~~~~
The best place for additional help is the Swift user mailing list. You can
subscribe to this list at
link:https://lists.ci.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/swift-user[swift-user].
When submitting information, send your sites.xml file, your tc.data, and
any Swift log files that were created during your attempt.
