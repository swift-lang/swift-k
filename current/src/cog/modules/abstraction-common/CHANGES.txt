(01/21/2010)

*** Added stage-in, stage-out and cleanup fields to job
    specifications.

*** Added open(Input|Output)Stream methods to file resources

*** Updated version to 2.4 due to major api changes

(04/07/2008)

*** SecurityContextImpl, ServiceImpl, and ServiceContactImpl now
    properly implement equals() and hashCode()

(03/26/2008)

*** Made a few objects serializable.

*** Removed heavy use of hashtables for things where fields
    work much better.
    
*** Changed implementation of Identity to be more conservative
    towards memory usage (i.e. removed the silly URI)

(02/12/2008)

*** Finally fixed the notification order. A task is now 
    guaranteed to go through the complete status lifecycle
    and that no out-of-order status events will occur (e.g.
    no Active after Completed). 

(11/23/2007)

*** Fixed broken isDirectory file operation

*** Caching of file resources happens on both host name, port and
    provider rather than just the host name

(08/23/2007)

*** Added ability to query for a list of providers supporting
    a certain type of task handler.
    
*** Deprecated Service.JOB_SUBMISSION. Use Service.EXECUTION.

(08/20/2007)

*** Made the way redirection works more consistent. As it was, a flag
    (JobSpecification.setRedirected(true)) would be used to indicate
    that redirection was desired. That, combined with whether the 
    stdout files were null or not, would dictate, in twisted ways, whether 
    the output would be redirected to a remote file, a local file, or an
    in-memory object. The way it works now is that for each file (stdin, 
    executable, stdout, stderr) a location can be specified. The location
    can be either memory, local or remote, or an arbitrary combination
    of these. So, for example, the stdout could be redirected to both
    a remote file and an in-memory object, while the stderr would be 
    redirected to a local file. Not all providers will support all
    combinations of these (GT2 will probably only be able to redirect
    to one thing at a time). A few things were also deprecated as a 
    consequence: 
       JobSpecification.setRedirected
       JobSpecification.setLocalExecutable
       JobSpecification.setLocatInput
       
*** Oh, and application failures caused by non-zero exit codes now have
    their own exception (JobException), which can also be used to 
    retrieve the exit code nicely.

(07/28/2007)

*** Added a thirdPartyIfPossible property to file transfer specifications.
    The behavior of the existing thirdParty flag in implementations would
    be to fail if the flag is set to true, but no actual third party transfer
    is possible (due to, for example, the providers not supporting it).
    The new flag allows a lenient request to be made. If this flag is set, 
    implementations should attempt 3rd party transfers if possible, but
    fall back to simulating it if necessary.

(05/18/2007)

*** Better (more consistent) way to specify delegation

(03/11/2007)

*** The file operation task handler used many cascading ifs with 
    equalsIgnoreCase tests. Better to convert the string to lowercase
	in the beginning
	
*** Cleaned up some of the task handlers. They kept lists or vectors
    of tasks in various states and did O(n) operations for things that
	they aren't even used for in general.

(02/05/2007)

*** Added two methods to FileResource to allow transfers that provide
    progress information

(01/28/2007)

*** Changed IOExceptions in file resources to IrrecoverableResourceExcepion.
    It's a sub-class of FileResourceException, it allows chaining, 
	and it is more intuitive.
	
*** Added better handling of irrecoverable prblems for caching handlers.

(12/30/2006)

*** Added FILEINFO operation to the FileOperationSpecification. It
    returns a GridFile which contains information about a file such
	as size, permissions, etc.

-------------------------------2.2----------------------------------

(11/28/2006)

*** Cleaned up file resources:
      - removed GeneralException and replaced it with FileResourceExcepion
	    and IOException (to distinguish between protocol level errors
		and communication problems)
	  - added an AbstractFileResource class and moved most of the common
	    things in the implementations there.

(10/18/2006)

*** Added a MKDIRS file operation (it creates a full directory path)

*** Asynchronously stop cached resources

(10/05/2006)

*** Cleaned up the JobSpecification interface and the implementation

(08/29/2006)

*** Merged with abstraction-examples


(07/24/2006)

*** Replaced the broken DeferredCommitHashSet.

*** Added Status.isTerminal()

-------------------------------2.1----------------------------------

(04/18/2006)

*** Added support for partial transfers

*** Removed commons-logging.jar. It was not used here

(04/06/2006)

*** Made the file resource cache timer a daemon

*** Added JobSpecification.isDelegationEnabled() and
    setDelegationEnabled(boolean)
	
*** Fixed 3rd party transfers. The file name would be appended to
    the host without the separating slash.

(11/23/2005)

*** Rewrote part of the generic transfer handler. It now covers a few more cases
    such as ssh to gridftp and back transfers. It also avoids temporary files
	when not needed
	
*** Added Task.waitFor(); it blocks until the task completes/failes/is canceled

(09/30/2005) 	

*** Removed the old sandboxing strategy. The new one allows for 
    concurrent requests. The context class loader is changed before a call
    then restored after a call to a sandboxed class.
		
*** Updated the caching file handler to always release resources
    after being done.
		
*** Added the trap logic to the factory in order to detect possibly
    improper class path settings.

(09/08/2005)

*** Updated the castor jar to version 0.9.6

(08/27/2005)

*** Improved the Javadoc comments of the abstractions interfaces 

(08/23/2005)

*** Fixed Bug: 
    http://www.cogkit.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=32 

(06/24/2005)

*** Updated the thirdparty file transfer logic to get proper 
    status notification on transfer COMPLETE in 
    org.globus.cog.abstraction.impl.fileTransfer.DelegatedFileTransferHandler.java

(06/08/2005)

*** Added support for service attributes in service.xsd schema and
    org.globus.cog.abstraction.impl.xml package

(06/08/2005)

*** Added support for JobManager abstractions in 
    org.globus.cog.abstraction.interfaces.ExecutionService.java and
    org.globus.cog.abstraction.impl.common.task.ExecutionServiceImpl.java 

(05/24/2005)

*** Added support for environment variables in 
    org.globus.cog.abstraction.interfaces.JobSpecification.java and 
    org.globus.cog.abstraction.impl.common.task.JobSpecificationImpl.java 

(05/10/2005)

*** Fixed the concurrent modification of the available Vector in 
    org.globus.cog.abstraction.impl.common.taskgraph.TaskGraphHandlerImpl.java

(05/03/2005)

*** Committed fixes for http://www.cogkit.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=90 

(05/02/2005)

*** Made the loadProviderProperties method in AbstractionProperties
    synchronized, so multiple parallel requests to it will work as expected.
		
(04/18/2005)

*** Renamed the module from "core-common" to 
    "abstraction-common"

-------------------------------2.0----------------------------------

(04/08/2005)

*** Updated config file deployment to not fail when individual
    files are missing, but rather copy what is available. Such behaviour
    is not intended to make it in to a release, but it's better for testing
		
(03/24/2005)

*** Updated the implementation of 
    org.globus.cog.core.impl.common.task.FileOperationSpecificationImpl.java
    to make it compatible with the updated interfaces

(03/24/2005)

*** Cleaned the implementation of 
    org.globus.cog.core.impl.file.TaskHandlerImpl.java
    and made it compatible with the updated interfaces 

(03/24/2005)

*** Streamlined the interface definition for 
    FileOperationSpecification, FileResource, and 
    GridFile	

-------------------------------1.0----------------------------------
