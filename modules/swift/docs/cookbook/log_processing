Log Processing
---------------

To properly generate log plots, you must enable VDL/Karajan logging. Make sure
log4j.properties contains:
----
log4j.logger.swift=DEBUG
log4j.logger.org.globus.cog.abstraction.coaster.service.job.manager.Cpu=DEBUG
----

Make a basic load plot from Coasters Cpu log lines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.Generate the log (may set log4j.logger.swift=INFO for this one)
(assuming the log is titled swift-run.log)

.Convert the log times to Unix time

----
./iso-to-secs < swift-run.log > swift-run.time
----

.Make the start time file (this contains the earliest timestamp)

----
make LOG=swift-run.log start-time.tmp
----

or 

----
extract-start-time swift-run.log > start-time.tmp
----

.Normalize the transition times

----
./normalise-event-start-time < swift-run.time > swift-run.norm
----

.Build up a load data file:

----
./cpu-job-load.pl < swift-run.norm > load.data
----

.Plot with the JFreeChart-based plotter in usertools/plotter:

----
lines.zsh load.cfg load.eps load.data
----

Make a basic job completion plot from Coasters Cpu log lines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.Same as above, but, build up a completed data file:

----
./cpu-job-completed.pl < swift-run.norm > completed.data
----

.Plot with the JFreeChart-based plotter in usertools/plotter:

----
lines.zsh completed.cfg completed.eps completed.data
----

Make a basic Block allocation plot from Coasters Block log lines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Same as above, but:

.Build up a block allocation data file:

----
./block-level.pl < swift-run.norm > blocks.data
----

.Plot with the JFreeChart-based plotter in usertools/plotter:

----
lines.zsh blocks.{cfg,eps,data}
----

Problem Reporting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When reporting problems to swift-user@ci.uchicago.edu, attach the
following files and information:
 
. tc.data and sites.xml (or whatever you named these files)

. your .swift source file and any .swift files it imports

. any external mapper scripts called by your .swift script

. all text from standard output and standard error produced by running the
swift command

. The .log file from this run. It will be named swiftscript.uniqueID.log

. where "swiftscript" is the name of your *.swift script source file, and
uniqueID is a long unique id which starts with the date and time you ran the
swift command.

. The swift command line you invoked

. Any swift.properties entries you over-rode ($HOME/.swift/swift.properties,
-config.file argument properties file, any changes to etc/swift.proerties from
your swift distribution)

. Which swift distribution you are running (release; svn revisions; other
local changes you mave have made or included)
