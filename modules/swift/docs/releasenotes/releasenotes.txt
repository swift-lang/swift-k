Swift 0.94 Release Notes
========================

Iterate changes
--------------- 
To behavior of iterate has changed from 0.93 to 0.94. The until() clause of 
the iterate statement now causes the loop to stop as soon as the until clause
returns "true", instead of doing one additional iteration when the clause 
turns true.

For example, iterate code in 0.93 might say:
-----
iterate i {
...
} until (i == 9);
-----
To achieve the same 10 executions in 0.94, you must say:
-----
iterate i {
...
} until (i==10);
-----

More information about iterate can be found in the 
http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/guides/release-0.94/userguide/userguide.html#_iterate[iterate section of the Swift User Guide].

Coaster walltimes
-----------------
Walltimes are now strictly enforced by coasters. 

There are two coaster properties that affect how walltimes are handled. They 
are maxtime and maxwalltime. 

Maxtime is the maximum amount of time, in seconds, that a coaster block can run.
This is defined in sites.xml.

.Setting a maxTime of 30 minutes
-----
<profile namespace="globus" key="maxTime">1800</profile>
-----

The maxwalltime property defines the maximum amount of time that any given
application may run (in hh:mm:ss format)

.Setting a maxWallTime of 5 minutes
-----
<profile namespace="globus" key="maxWallTime">00:05:00</profile>
-----

An application may run up to the the limit defined in maxwalltime, and are 
packed into coasters slots that run for maxtime seconds. 


In versions of Swift prior to 0.94, if an application exceeded its specified 
maxwalltime, execution would continue. However, if the application exceeded 
its maxwalltime, the queuing system could kill the worker. The resulting error 
message was not always very clear. 

In Swift 0.94, coaster workers enforce the user-specified 
maxwalltime. If an application exceeds its maxwalltime, the coaster worker 
will not allow it to continue, but terminate it and report the error.

The error message will look something like this:
-----
Execution failed:
	Exception in hostsnsleep:
    Arguments: [30]
    Host: midway
    Directory: hostsnsleep-20130502-2009-t8m0l3hb/jobs/n/hostsnsleep-n55v8x8l
    stderr.txt: 
    stdout.txt: midway009

-----

TIP: Maxwalltime may also be define on a per application level in your tc file 
(http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/guides/release-0.94/userguide/userguide.html#_globus_namespace[Globus Namespace section, Swift User Guide]).

Camel Case Functions
--------------------
To make things more consistent, many swift functions are being renamed
to use camel case naming. For example, @toint is now @toInt. The previous 
naming conventions will still work in 0.94, but may not in future releases.
If you try to use a function which has been renamed, you will see deprecated 
warnings like this:
-----
Warning: Function toint is deprecated, at 2
-----
Below is a list of functions with updated names.

[options="header", width="25%"]
|===========================
| Old Name    | New Name
| @extractint | @extractInt
| @toint      | @toInt
| @tofloat    | @toFloat
| @tostring   | @toString
|===========================


Associative Arrays 
------------------
Associative arrays have been added. By default, array keys are integers, but in 
0.94 other primitive types are also allowed as array keys. More details and 
examples can be found in the
http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/guides/release-0.94/userguide/userguide.html#_associative_arrays[associate array section of the Swift User Guide].

Dynamic profiles
----------------
Many settings formerly only definable in sites.xml can now
be set on a per-app basis. This can make things easier when running
multiple apps that have different requirements for settings like processors
per node and walltime. 

More information and examples can be found in the 
http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/guides/release-0.94/userguide/userguide.html#_dynamic_profiles[dynamic profiles section of the Swift User Guide]

SSH command line provider
-------------------------
Added a new ssh command line provider. Previously ssh support was done by 
creating a file called ~/.ssh/auth.defaults. The ssh command line provider
is more flexible and doesn't require this step. ssh-cl allows you to use
your existing SSH agents. You can use ssh-cl to run remotely by adding 
something like this to your sites.xml:

-----
  <execution provider="coaster" url="my.host.uchicago.edu" jobmanager="ssh-cl:pbs"/>
-----

Coaster provider staging improvements
-------------------------------------
Coasters provides a mechanism for transferring files between hosts, called
coaster provider staging. Coaster provider staging is explained in more
detail in http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/papers/UCC-coasters.pdf[this
research paper].

In 0.94 there have been many fixes and improvements to make coaster
provider staging more reliable.

Added support for the Slurm scheduler
-------------------------------------
Swift 0.94 includes support for Slurm - an open source job scheduler used on 
many supercomputers and computer clusters. 

The http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/guides/trunk/siteguide/siteguide.html#_midway_x86_cluster[Swift Site Guide entry for Midway]
has an entry containing information about how to run Swift on a specific Slurm 
cluster at the University of Chicago called Midway. By changing queue names
and project names, this information could be used to run on any Slurm cluster.

Added support for the LSF scheduler
-----------------------------------
Swift 0.94 includes support for the LSF (Load Sharing Facility) scheduler. An
example sites.xml can be found in the 
http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/guides/release-0.94/siteguide/siteguide.html#_geyser_and_caldera_x86_clusters[Swift Site Guide entry for Geyser].

Condor Improvements
-------------------
Some improvements have been made to the condor provider. For condor systems
without a shared filesystem, Swift can now use Condor's built-in file transfer
mechanisms to transfer the scripts it needs to starts jobs. To do this, you can
define the jobtype to "non-shared" in sites.xml.

-----
<profile namespace="globus"  key="jobType">nonshared</profile>
-----

An example setup that uses this style of configuration can be found in the 
http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/guides/release-0.94/siteguide/siteguide.html#_uc3_x86_cluster[Swift siteguide entry for the UC3 cluster].

Textual User Interface
----------------------
Fixes for the textual user interface (TUI). Adding the -tui option to the swift 
command line allows you to monitor progress in a curses based menu. For example:
-----
swift -sites.file sites.xml -tc.file tc.data -tui myscript.swift
-----

A brief example of this can be found at http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/~davidk/modis.ogv.

@java
-----
Added the ability to call Java methods within swift using @java. For example:
-----
float f = @java("java.lang.Math", "sin", 0.5);
-----
More information can be found in the 
http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/guides/release-0.94/userguide/userguide.html#_java[Swift User Guide entry on @java].

Hang Checker
------------
Added a hang checker that provides the user with more information about 
potential hangs. Here is one example of a situation that may cause Swift
to hang:

-----
int a;
int b;

a = b;
b = a;
-----

When this script is run, you will now see a more detailed message explaining
what's happening.

-----
Dependency loop found:
	b (declared on line 2) is needed by: 
		a = b, test.swift, line 5
	which produces a (declared on line 1)

	a (declared on line 1) is needed by: 
		b = a, test.swift, line 6
	which produces b (declared on line 2)
-----

@strjoin
-------- 
A function called @strjoin function for joining strings. More information and examples are
in the 
http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/guides/release-0.94/userguide/userguide.html#_strjoin[Swift User Guide section on @strjoin].

Worker Init Command
-------------------
If you have a requirement that a command get run on the worker node before 
processing any work, worker.pl will now execute commands stored in the
environment variable $WORKER_INIT_CMD.

-----
export WORKER_INIT_CMD=/path/to/script.to.run
-----

Swift Userhome
--------------
Swift creates some files it needs by default in your home directory. If
your home filesystem is not available on the worker nodes of a cluster you are
trying to use, this can cause tasks to fail. Setting the environment variable 
SWIFT_USERHOME to the location of a shared filesystem will get around this 
restriction.

MPI Improvements
----------------
Swift 0.94 has improved MPI support and integration. Details about how to 
run MPI jobs in Swift can be found in the
http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/guides/release-0.94/userguide/userguide.html#_launching_mpi_jobs_from_swift[the MPI section of the Swift User Guide].
