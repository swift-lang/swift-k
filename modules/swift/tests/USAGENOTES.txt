Swift Test Suite Usage Notes
=============================
:Author Initials: swift-devel
:website: http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/main/

The script will (optionally) checkout Swift, run several tests in a
subdirectory called *run-_DATE_*, and generate useful HTML output and
*tests.log*.  Tests are grouped into test *GROUPs*.

.Usage:
******************************************
 suite.sh <options>* <GROUPLISTFILE|GROUP>
******************************************

1. Primary Usage Mode
---------------------
.Options:
[width="30%",cols="s,15",options="header"]
|==============================================
|Options  |  Output
|-a       |  Do not run ant dist.
|-c       |  Do not remove dist (clean)
|-f       |  Generate plain text output file.
|-h       |  This table.
|-k <N>   |  Skip first N tests.
|-n <N>   |  Run N tests and quit.
|-p       |  Do not build the package.
|-s       |  Do not do a fresh svn checkout.
|-t       |  Tree mode (alias: -a,-c,-g,-p,-s)
|-x       |  Do not continue after a failure.
|-v       |  Verbose (set -x, HTML comments).
|-o output|  Location for cog and output.
|<GROUP>  |  GROUP argument.
|==============================================
Assuming your code is in *_/tmp/cog_*, where you
have the conventional *_cog/modules/swift_* configuration,
and you have done an *ant dist*, you can run
*********************************************************
 suite.sh -t -o /tmp $PWD/groups/group-all-local.sh
*********************************************************
or *cd* into */tmp* and run
**************************************************************
 suite.sh -t cog/modules/swift/tests/groups/group-all-local.sh
**************************************************************
The *-t* option is "Tree mode"- as in, "test my existing source tree"

Run *suite.sh -h* for quick help
When something goes wrong, find and check *tests.log* or use *-v*

The script generates by default an HTML report, use *-f* to change
the output to plain text.

2. Swift Location
-----------------
The *TOPDIR* (*PWD* by default) is set with the *-o* option. Code is checked out into this directory or must already exist there.
The variables *COG_VERSION* and *SWIFT_VERSION* must be set for code checkout.

.e.g.
*********************************************************************
 COG_VERSION=branches/4.1.8, SWIFT_VERSION=branches/release-0.92
*********************************************************************

Swift is compiled and installed in its source tree.
The run is executed in *RUNDIR* (*TOPDIR/RUNDIRBASE*)
The build test is started in *TOPDIR*.
Everything for a Swift test is written in its *RUNDIR*
The temporary output always goes to *OUTPUT* (*TOPDIR/exec.out*)

3. Helper Scripts
-----------------
Each *.swift* test may be accompanied by a:

- *.setup.sh*
- *.check.sh*
- *.clean.sh*
- *.timeout specifier.*

The scripts may setup and inspect files in *RUNDIR*
including *exec.out* which must be accessed in *stdout.txt*
because the currently running tested process writes to
*exec.out*; *stdout.txt* is a copy.

The *GROUP* scripts can read the *GROUP* variable. The timeout number in the *\*.timeout* file overrides the default timeout.

4. Test Structure
-----------------

Tests are *GROUPed* into directories. Each *GROUP* directory has:

1. a list of *.swift* tests (plus *.sh* scripts).
2. optionally a *sites.template.xml*.
3. optionally a *tc.template.data*.
4. optionally a *fs.template.data*.
5. optionally a *swift.properties*.
6. optionally a *title.txt*.
7. preferably a *README.txt*.
8. optionally a *.timeout*.

****************************************************************************************************
Template files are lightly processed by *sed* before use. Missing files will be pulled from *_swift/etc_*
****************************************************************************************************

5. What Tests are Run
---------------------
Each *.swift* file is a test; *suite.sh* launches all tests in each *GROUP* in the *GROUPLIST*.

The *GROUPLIST* is obtained from the *GROUPARG*.

1. The *GROUPARG* can be an external script in the groups/ subdirectory by the name of *GROUPLISTFILE*.
The *GROUPLISTFILE*:

 a. sets the array.
 b. checks any variables needed by *_make_sites_sed()_*.

2. Or, the *GROUPARG* can just be a directory name that is the name of the singleton *GROUP*.

*OUTPUT* is the stdout of the current test *stdout.txt* retains _stdout_ from the previous test (for *.clean.sh*)
*output_*
*
*.txt* is the HTML-linked permanent output from a test.

*******************************************
All timeouts in this script are in seconds
*******************************************

6. PID Tree
-----------
Background processes are used so that hung Swift jobs can be killed
These are the background processes (*PIDs* are tracked)

- suite.sh
 a.  monitor()
 b.  sleep
- process_exec()
 a. bin/swift
 b. java

*PID* management is now pretty good, but you may want to check *ps*
from time to time and keep *xload* running.
Note that Coasters may temporarily prevent Swift from exiting upon
receiving a signal

(*cf. CoasterService.addLocalHook()*).

7. Failure Cases
----------------
Some cases are designed to cause Swift to crash.  These
SwiftScripts contain the token *_THIS-SCRIPT-SHOULD-FAIL_* somewhere.

The response of *suite.sh* to the exit code of these Swift
executions is reversed.

Additionally, some tests may be in a known state of disrepair.  These
SwiftScripts contain the token *_SKIP-THIS-TEST_* somewhere, which will
cause the test suite to skip that test.

8. Schedulers
-------------
Environment must contain *PROJECT*, *QUEUE*, and *WORK*.
These variables will be incorporated into the *sites.xml*
via:

*make_sites_sed()* -> *group_sites_xml()*

Note that some schedulers restrict your choice of *RUNDIR*

9. Naming
---------
Site-specific test groups are in _providers/_.
These are named:

_providers/<provider description>/_

or:

_providers/<provider description>/<site>_

.E.g.,
***********************************
 providers/local-pbs/PADS
***********************************

10. Adding Tests to Existing Groups
-----------------------------------
Simply add a *.swift* file to a *GROUP* directory.
That script will be launched when the *GROUP* is tested.
Optionally, you may add helper scripts (see above) to setup,
check, and clean up after tests.

The helper scripts are launched from the *RUNDIR* and have access
to files in *RUNDIR* and environment variables from *suite.sh*
such as *$GROUP*. Thus, you can:

.Bring in input files:
*********************************************************
 cp $GROUP/input-file.txt .
*********************************************************

.Check output:
*********************************************************
 grep TEXT1 exec.out
 grep TEXT2 output-file.txt
*********************************************************

.Clean up (optional):
*********************************************************
 rm output-file.txt
*********************************************************

The results are added to the HTML output, etc., automatically.
The prefix number on each test is simply for sorting

.E.g.,
******************
 ls *.swift
******************

11. Adding Test Groups
----------------------
If no existing group has the sites, tc, etc. that you need to test,
you will need to add a test group.  Simply create a new directory.
Add files from *TEST STRUCTURE* if necessary; missing files will be
filled in with defaults.

12. Improving This Test Suite
-----------------------------
This is a work in progress. Here are some things you can do:

- Run it!  Report problems to swift-devel.
- Fix broken tests.
- Break down test *GROUPs* into smaller, meaningful *GROUPs* ; it would be good to limit *GROUP* sizes to 20 or so tests.
- Current work has focused on the HTML and stdout output, which is intended to be high-level and clean.

***********************************************************************************
Using -v results in extremely verbose output.
Some happy medium could be achieved by improving the use of the *LOG* (*tests.log*).
************************************************************************************

13. Problems
------------
If you have a problem:

- Use *-v* to get the *set -x* output.
- Use *ps -H* to get the *PID* tree.

14. Warnings
------------
- *suite.sh* uses *shopt*.

15. Additional Notes
---------------------
- *run-suite.sh*:
 a. Wrapper for *suite.sh*.
 b. Env variables set may be customized by user.

- *meta.sh*:
 a. Wrapper for *run-suite.sh*.
 b. used to execute _run-suite/suite.sh_ from a remote site using *ssh*.
