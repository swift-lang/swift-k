(07/05/11)

*** Provenance tracking in the compiled file is now disabled by default.
    Enable with swift -enable.provenance <script>
    
*** Variables that go out of scope are now automatically cleaned. This 
    mostly consists of nullifying various fields, but for the concurrent
    mapper it also means removal of files

*** Fixed iterate so that iterate i {} until (i > 3); does not include
    an iteration in which i == 3.

(07/01/11)

*** Uninitialized variables are detected at compile time instead of causing
    a run to hang
    
*** A previous commit to deal with future faults occurring in the middle of
    a deep copy would incorrectly handle multi-dimensional arrays. This is
    now fixed.

(02/17/10)

*** Fixed deadlock when iterating on an array that is being written to
    in a foreach loop

(07/03/09)
*** New import keyword which allows other SwiftScript source files to be
    imported.

(07/01/09)
*** New writeData procedure which writes data structures to files in the same
    format as used by readData.

(06/30/09)
*** New parameter -condor-g for swift-osg-ress-site-catalog which causes
    sites files to be generate which will use a local condor-g installation
    instead of making direct GRAM submissions.

(06/25/09)
*** 'global' keyword to allow top level declarations to be visible in all
    scopes.

(05/17/09)
*** Allow wrapper parameters to be specific in a file rather than on the
    commandline. This trades commandline length for an extra file to stage-in
    per job.
    A new parameter, wrapper.parameter.mode, is introduced to control this.
    This was feature request bug 201.

(05/07/09)
*** swift-log-to-cedps is removed. The functionality of generating
    .cedps format files is available by specifying the desired .cedps files
    in an invocation of swift-plot-log. Lack of widespread use of this
    command means a deprecation period is probably unnecessary.

(05/05/09)
*** New configuration property provenance.log which controls whether verbose
    provenance-related log information is recorded in the run log file or
    not. By default, this is false, which means that less information is
    output by default now than previously.

(04/27/09)
*** Swift 0.9 built from Swift SVN r2860 and cog SVN r2388

(03/30/09)
*** Removed support for .dtm file extension which was deprecated in Swift 0.4

(03/29/09)
*** Added console text interface to provide live information about swift 
    runs.

(03/27/09)
*** Environment variable SWIFT_EXTRA_INFO, when set in an environment profile,
    is executed with the result being recorded in wrapper logs. This allows
    arbitrary information about the remote environment to be gathered and
    returned to the submit side.

*** The wrapper.sh and seq.sh scripts that are deployed to remote sites to
    help with execution have been renamed to more Swift specific names, to
    avoid collision with user-supplied files of the same name. The new names
    are _swiftwrap and _swiftseq

(03/15/09)
*** The log-processing code, primarily exposed as the swift-plot-log command,
    has been merged into the main Swift release, rather than being a separate
    download.

(03/09/09)
*** Added a throttling parallelFor and changed the swift foreach underlying
    implementation to it. The throttling parallelFor limits the number of
    concurrent iterations allowed, which should allow swift to scale better
    in certain cases.

(02/24/09)
*** New configuration option wrapper.invocation.mode, specifiable either
    globally in the configuration file or per-site as a profile key,
    that configures whether wrapper script invocations are made with an
    absolute path (as was the behaviour in Swift 0.8) or with a relative
    path (as was behaviour in previous versions of Swift).

(02/22/09)
*** Recompilation will happen if a .kml file was compiled with a different
    version of Swift to the version being invoked. This is in addition to the
    existing behaviour where a .swift file will be recompiled if it is newer
    than the corresponding .kml file.

(02/17/09)
*** There is a new command swift-osg-ress-site-catalog which will generate
    a site catalog based on data gathered from OSG's ReSS information
    system. This can be used by OSG users to easily generate a large number
    of site catalog entries for sites that are likely to work.

(02/14/09)
*** Handling of [*] and . has changed. [*] has been broken for several
    Swift releases, but now has some approximation of its former behaviour,
    in a cleaner implementation.
    [*] is now an identity operation, that is array[*] == array.
    The structure access operator . can now take an array on the left
    hand side. In situations where a[*].img was used, it is permissible
    to continue to write a[*].img, or to write a.img - both of these will
    return an array of img elements.

(02/09/09)
*** Procedure invocations can be made in any expression context now, rather
    than only directly in an assignment.

*** Mappings can now be made in any declaration, whether it has an assignment
    or not. Previous a procedure call assignment and a mapping could not be
    made in the same statement.

(02/05/09)
*** Tighter type checking on app blocks. Primitive types and arrays of
    primitive types are permitted. Other types are prohibited.

*** Arrays of primitive types can be passed to app blocks, and will be
    expanded into multiple command-line parameters, one parameter per
    array element.

(01/23/09)
*** Swift 0.8 built from Swift SVN r2448 and cog SVN r2261

(01/14/09)
*** Application success/failure status reporting can now be done using
    CoG provider status, rather than the previous only choice of
    using status files on the shared file system. A status.mode parameter
    has been added to set this. It can be configured either in the
    swift.properties file, to have effect for all sites, or can be set
    per-site.

(01/10/09)
*** Console output for individual application invocation start and finish
    is no longer shown. The progress ticker now appears more often.
    This should give a better overview of run progress.

*** More parallelisation of execution, so that some constructs which should
    have always work now actually work. For example, mappers can take
    values as parameters which are not known "early" in a run, and will
    have their initialisation deferred until those parameters are ready.
    SwiftScript programs which previously worked should still work; and
    some programs which did not previously work should now work.

(11/11/08)
*** Swift 0.7 built from Swift SVN r2318 and cog SVN r2255

(08/15/08)
*** Swift 0.6 built from Swift SVN r2177 and cog SVN r2127

(06/06/08)
*** SWIFT_JOBDIR_PATH environment variable can be use in profiles (or
    anywhere else that will get it to the worker script) to cause the
    worker to copy input files to a possibly-worker-node-local working
    directory.

(04/24/08)
*** PATHPREFIX environment variable is prefixed to the path before execution
    in wrapper.sh; this variable can be set in profile entries using the usual
    environment variables

(04/14/08)
*** Constant interning - this reduces the number of datasets for local values
    created, especially when constants are used in loops.

(04/09/08)
*** Swift 0.5 built from Swift SVN r1783 and CoG SVN r1962

(03/26/08)
*** String literals now use \ as escape character - for example, use \"
    to insert a quote into a string literal. Where \ was previously used
    in a string literal, it is now necessary to escape it as \\

(03/25/08)

*** Logging performance improvement in wrapper.sh

(03/15/08)
*** Unused lrc field in site catalog removed.

*** url field in site catalog execute element is now optional.

(03/13/08)

*** Swift v0.4 built from Swift SVN r1718 and cog SVN r1934.

(03/03/08)
*** Stage out wrapper log files in a similar fashion to kickstart records.

(02/28/08)
*** Progress ticker on stderr every 10..60 seconds

*** Store kickstart records in a subdirectory with the same base name as
    is used for log files.

(02/27/08)
*** SwiftScript source file line numbers are now passed deeper into the
    compiler in order to give location information in more error messages.
    This has resulted in a schema change for the XML intermediate form.

(02/26/08)
*** Better compile-time checking of variable usage. Use of undeclared
    variables and multiple assignments to the same variable will now result
    in a compile-time error (close to the start of a run), rather than an
    error during execution (which may be many hours later).

(01/25/08)
*** @arg now takes a second optional argument which stands for a default
    value in case the command line argument is missing.

(01/14/08)
*** Overloaded '+' operator to allow string concatenation

(01/05/08)
*** Multidimensional array handling. Can now declare arrays like this:
       file f[][];
    and refer to elements like this:
       f[1][1]
    f[1] refers to a one dimensional array, in the style of Java arrays.

(12/18/07)
*** r1214 made type specification illegal in a foreach but still recognised it
    and threw an error.  This commit removes recognition of that from the
    parser entirely (as was intended to eventually happen when r1214 was made)

*** Complete removal of "while" statements from the language.
    They do not seem to have a use, and haven't worked for some months
    due to their removal from the XML intermediate form.

(12/07/07)
*** Deprecated use of .dtm extension for source files. Use .swift instead.
    Support for .dtm will be dropped eventually.

(12/03/07)
*** Added -runid parameter that specifies the run identifier on the command
    line, rather than having it automatically generated. This must
    be unique for every invocation of a workflow and is used in several
    places to keep files from different executions cleanly separated. By
    default, a datestamp and random number are used to generate a run
    identifier. When using this parameter, care should be taken to ensure
    that the run ID remains unique with respect to all other run IDs that
    might be used, irrespective of (at least) expected run location,
    workflow or user.

(11/23/07)
*** new parameter, execution.retries to specify the number of time a job
    will be retried if it fails (giving a maximum of 1 + execution.retries
    attempts at execution)

*** Added filesystem site catalog element. Looks like 'execution' and
    allows, for example, SSH to be used for remote filesystem access.

(11/20/07)

*** Many unused fields in the sites catalog, sites.xml, are now optional.

*** Nested statement blocks are no longer supported. These saw little use
    and were buggy.

(11/01/07)

*** Concurrent mapper now generates filenames in a relatively deep directory
    hierarchy in order to reduce the number of files in each directory.
    There is a (hard-coded) parameter which determines how many files and
    subdirectories will be permitted at each level. This parameter is set
    to 25.

*** move various job related directories into subdirs on site-side.
    at present, the subdirs are named by a single digit directory.

(10/31/07)

*** Added an external mapper to allow invoking a script to do the
    actual mapping

(10/08/07)

*** Added readData function

(10/03/07)

*** Profile names/keys in tc.data are now case insensitive

(10/02/07)

*** Swift 0.3 release candidate 1 built from swift svn r1312, cog r1769

(09/28/07)

*** Clustering is now disabled by default.

*** Over the past week, a number of changes have been made to the logging
    output of Swift to make it richer. This is likely to break existing
    log processing code.

(09/19/07)

*** Subtle changes to the behaviour of AbstractFileMapper and its subclasses
    (primarily any of the mappers that take prefix, suffix or location
    parameters). The behaviour of prefixes and suffixes was not consistent
    between forward and reverse mapping - this has been made more consistent.
    Prefixes are now added when mapping directly as strings, rather than
    passing them through the path component mapping code first. Handling of
    separators between fields is slightly changed to accomodate this - a
    special case for the first separator is removed. Detection of the
    types of fields/indices in a path is now done using Path.Entry methods
    rather than guessing based on the first character of the field name.

*** Added lots of debug logging to AbstractFileMapper

(09/18/07)

*** Add a basic iterate {} language construct, and an @extractint function
    that can be used with it.

*** Add a @regexp language function which provides more regular expression
    functionality than is provided by @strcut. This is intended to allow
    the regular expression mapper to be removed (with uses of it replaced
    with the single file mapper and the @regexp function)

(09/13/07)

*** Changed lazy error default from true to false. This affect how
    Swift handles workflows when an error occurs. See the userguide
    for further details.

(09/10/07)

*** Removed ability to specify type of index variable in foreach loops. This
    type was never checked. Any programs which specify the type in a foreach
    statement will need a code modification to remove that type specification.
    Making such a change will not modify workflow behaviour.

(09/08/07)

*** Changed the way arguments are passed to the wrapper. This
    should be more resilient to broken middleware that doesn't
    properly quote arguments.

(09/04/07)

*** Updated wrapper to be more thorough at diagnosing problems.

(08/29/07)

*** Moved @arg to swiftscript namespace/package

*** @filenames disappeared at some point in time. It is back.

*** Fixed some issues with paths returned by fringePaths being
    parsed into the wrong things. It points out that one should 
    be careful about methods typically used to get some human 
    readable representation of data (such as toString()) being 
    relied on to provide any kind of functional consistency.

(08/28/07)

*** Added throttle.score.job.factor to swift.properties (the functionality
    was previously available by manually hacking scheduler.xml)
    
*** Throttle options now accept "off" as a valid value

*** Put @arg back in

*** Changes the configuration to allow loading a specific file even
    if the defaults cannot be found.
    
*** Added PBS and dCache providers as dependencies

*** Typechecks on arrays would fail (this was introduced by the type
    system changes). Fixed.
    
*** Assignments from integer[] to float[] should not fail for type
    reasons (nor should passing an integer[] for a float[] fail the
    typecheck).

(08/23/07)

*** A few changes to the way types work. Whether something is an array
    or not is part of the type now.
    
*** Cleanups to the way things get stored and mappers

*** It's not necessary to manually add task handlers any more. All the
    available ones are added automatically

(08/16/07)

*** A different site catalog element <execution> that fills a similar role
    to the existing <jobmanager> element with a syntax more sympathetic to
    submitting via non-GRAM submission systems.

(07/31/07)

*** Prototype structured_regexp_mapper for performing a regexp transformation
    on the filenames of one dataset to produce another dataset with the
    same structure but different leaf filenames.

(07/30/07)

*** All simple types are now passed around inside of DSHandle objects,
    instead of sometimes inside DSHandles and sometimes as rawer Java
    objects.

*** Swift operators now implemented in their own class, rather than using
    the Karajan implementation.

*** There are now two division operators, / and %/ of which the first (/)
    returns a floating point value and %/ returns an integer value.
    The mod operator is relabelled %% instead of %.
    
*** Mappers can now map files on remote sites (use protocol://host/path)
    for file name(s), and the engine can actually stage things in and out
    from/to arbitrary locations
    
*** Moved some path manipulation function to Java

(07/29/07)

*** Use /dev/urandom by default on UNIX platforms to avoid large
    delays at start-up (and Yoya knows when else). It will lower the
    security of anything that relies on java.security.SecureRandom 
    for RNG, but there is no nice way to initialize different SecureRandom
    instances with different seed generators.

(07/28/07)

*** Removed break; statement from the language. It was previously unimplemented
    and acted as a no-op. Any code which now does not compile can be made to
    compile by removing the break statements. No other changes should be
    necessary, and no behavioural changes should result.

(07/19/07)

*** Swift 0.2 release made from Swift SVN r915 and CoG SVN r1658

(05/21/07)

*** Add a mapper, array_mapper, which maps from a string array of filenames.
    This was requested in bug 27.

(04/27/07)

*** Fixed a deadlock in the remote caching code.

(04/12/07)

*** Marker types (that is, types with no content) can now be specified without
    an empty {} block. So what was previous written as:

      type imagefile {};

    can now be written as

      type imagefile;

(04/11/07)

*** CSV mapper will now take commas as a field separator (in addition to the
    existing behaviour of space and tab)

(03/23/07)

*** Fixed -resume

*** Fixed code dealing with command line arguments

(03/16/07)

*** Labels in graphs are quoted now

(03/12/07)

*** Cache remote directory structure creation.

(03/03/07)

*** Moved job directory creation to the wrapper

(03/03/07)

*** The default values for mapping parameters handling below
    did not allow implementations to get the value of an 
	optional parameter by checking if it's not null. This can
	now be done by specifying null as a default value.

(03/02/07)

*** Added log message to print full stack trace of exceptions
    that cause Swift to fail
	
*** Better handling of default values for mapping parameters, 
    and better handling of mapping parameter errors.

(03/01/07)

*** Fixed @arg.

(02/19/07)

*** Fixed a race in the cache

(02/16/07)

*** Fixed stdin issue (bug #19)

*** Fixed an issue with vdl:cacheAndLockFile considering files for 
    which the transfers failed as being actually cached.

(02/14/07)

*** Print usage  and exit instead of a nasty exception if the input 
    file does not exist (bug #15)

(02/13/07)

*** Ongoing parser changes

*** Make sure /bin and /usr/bin are added to the path in the
    wrapper.
	
*** When there's a NPE or CCE in an exception chain that causes the
    execution to fail, the full stack trace is printed.

(02/11/07)

*** SwiftScript syntax change: The function invocation (i=q)=f(1) must 
    be written with the () parentheses surrounding the return variables.
    Previously, the parentheses were optional, and the same could be written
    as i=q=f(1); This is no longer the case.

(02/10/07)

*** On-going parser changes primarily aimed at producing more user-friendly
    syntax errors but also including these syntax changes:
      - parser no longer recognises vestigial for(;;) construct
      - parser allows type declarations and other top level statements
        (aside from namespace declarations) to be mixed together. Previously,
        all type declarations had to occur before other statements.

(02/09/07)

*** Reorganized logging. Log always goes to a file. Console
    gets little stuff unless -verbose or -debug are used.
	
*** Use a unified run id which is used as a prefix for the
    log, the restart log, the provenance graph, and the 
	remote run directories
	
*** Hmm. Did I mess up the dates on the changelog?

*** Added default properties that work in case
    swift/etc/swift.properties is missing some.

(02/08/07)

*** Added option to always transfer Kickstart records

*** Improved error handling for compilation of SwiftScript code

(02/07/07)

*** Added Kickstart support (optional)

*** Added support for GLOBUS profiles in the site catalog

*** Updated error translations to include a pointer to the
    Kickstart info if available

(02/05/07)

*** Renamed a few things to swift, including:
    - vdl2.properties -> swift.properties
	- ~/.vdl2 -> ~/.swift (the old config is still read though)
	- the log4j "class" for things in Karajan (vdl2 -> swift)
	- vdlrun -> swift
	
*** swift (vdlrun) will also work with .dtm files now, and compile
    them on the fly.
	
*** Most of the throttle parameters are now settable through 
    swift.properties
	
*** Made some preliminary (and incomplete) changes towards integrating
    kickstart.

(02/02/07)

*** Renamed a few mappers to better reflect the mapper functionalities.

*** Added warnings mechanism

*** No more Karajan stack traces in errors (only simple chained messages).
    Those stack traces belong to the logging domain
	
*** Capture cleanup problems and print them as warnings

*** Added a few more error translation
 
(01/30/07)

*** Fixed vdlc to return a non-zero exit code when text->xml conversion
    fails.

(01/28/07)

*** Added support for non-standard attributes on the GLOBUS
    prefix in tc.data.

(01/18/07)

*** Fixed an issue with dependent mappers and arrays

*** Fixed the concurrent mapper

(01/12/07)

*** Added mapping dependencies.

(01/06/07)

*** Added a cache around the Pegasus TC file implementation.

*** Added vdl:log as a wrapper around log4j.

*** Fixed an issue in the cleanup with the same file being
    deleted multiple times concurrently.


(01/04/07)

*** Added a simple clustering mechanism for small jobs.

*** Added a "-dryrun" argument to vdlrun. If graph generation 
    is enabled, this should produce a graph without running
	any actual jobs.
	
*** Fixed an issue with caching where a file could have
    been purged more than once

(01/01/07)

*** Modified AbstractFileMapper to expose local variables as protected

*** Added a RegularExpressionMapper to do file name conversion based on regexp

*** Added a DirectoryMapper to map a list of files from a directory as an array

*** Added a CSVMapper to map a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file into a logical structure

(12/30/06)

*** A new vdlrun that is specific to VDL2.

*** Added an error translator (based on regular expressions)
    that can be used to provide improved error messages
	
*** Added a lazy errors mode in which errors in application
    execution are aggregated and reported only once at the
	end

*** Added provenance graph generation

*** Added a control mechanism for managing remote storage
    usage
	
*** Cleanups


------------------------- 0 rc 3 ---------------------------

(12/28/06)

*** The heuristics (in CoG) used to detect if a task can ever
    run (due to constraints as opposed to temporary load 
	conditions) were broken and the issue was fixed.

(12/23/06)
------------------------- 0 rc 2 ---------------------------

*** svn copy is broken so I'm noting the revision here: 115

(12/14/06)

*** Fixed the default mapper to be concurrent_mapper

*** Added passing of tc.data profiles to the job (e.g
    user-defined environment variables, jobtype, count, etc.)

------------------------- 0 rc 1 ---------------------------
(12/07/06)

*** Added dynamic loading of the TC file

*** Added cleanup which is done at the end of the
    whole run

(12/06/06)

*** Moved to CI SVN

*** Added tests directory

(11/22/06)

*** Changed to a pure Karajan adaptive scheduler instead
    of a Pegasus site selector
	
*** Added "client-side-caching" of remote files

*** Added a basic wrapper to capture exit codes and do other
    work before and after executing the job
