#
# The host name of the submit machine is used by GRAM as a callback
# address to report the status of submitted jobs. In general, Swift
# can automatically detect the host name of the local machine.
# However, if the machine host name is improperly configured or if
# it does not represent a valid DNS entry, certain services (such as
# GRAM) will not be able to send job status notifications back to
# the client. The value of this property can be an IP address.
#
# Format:
#    hostName=string
#


#hostName=localhost

#
# A TCP port range can be specified to restrict the ports on which GRAM
# callback services are started. This is likely needed if your submit
# host is behind a firewall, in which case the firewall should be
# configured to allow incoming connections on ports in the range.
#
# Format:
#     tcp.port.range=start,end
#

TCPPortRange="50000, 50100"

#
# false	- means an error will be immediately reported and cause the
# 		workflow to abort. At this time remote jobs that are already
#		running will not be canceled
# true	- means that Swift will try to do as much work as possible and
#		report all errors encountered at the end. However, "errors"
#		here only applies to job execution errors. Certain errors
#		that are related to the Swift implementation (should such
#		errors occur) will still be reported eagerly.

# Default: false

#
# Enables tracing of procedure invocations, assignments,

tracingEnabled=false

# For the throttling parameters, valid values are either a positive integer
# or "off" (without the quotes).
#

#
# Limits the number of concurrent submissions for a workflow instance. This
# throttle only limits the number of concurrent tasks (jobs) that are being
# sent to sites, not the total number of concurrent jobs that can be run.
# The submission stage in GRAM is one of the most CPU expensive stages (due
# mostly to the mutual authentication and delegation). Having too many
# concurrent submissions can overload either or both the submit host CPU
# and the remote host/head node causing degraded performance.
#
# Default: 4
#

jobSubmitThrottle=4
#jobSubmitThrottle=off

#
# Limits the number of concurrent submissions for any of the sites Swift will
# try to send jobs to. In other words it guarantees that no more than the
# value of this throttle jobs sent to any site will be concurrently in a state
# of being submitted.
#
# Default: 2
#

hostJobSubmitThrottle=2
#hostJobSubmitThrottle=off

#
# Limits the total number of concurrent file transfers that can happen at any
# given time. File transfers consume bandwidth. Too many concurrent transfers
# can cause the network to be overloaded preventing various other signalling
# traffic from flowing properly.
#
# Default: 4
#

fileTransfersThrottle=4
#fileTransfersThrottle=off

# Limits the total number of concurrent file operations that can happen at any
# given time. File operations (like transfers) require an exclusive connection
# to a site. These connections can be expensive to establish. A large number
# of concurrent file operations may cause Swift to attempt to establish many
# such expensive connections to various sites. Limiting the number of concurrent
# file operations causes Swift to use a small number of cached connections and
# achieve better overall performance.
#
# Default: 8
#

fileOperationsThrottle=8
#fileOperationsThrottle=off

# Indicates whether the working directory on the remote site should be
# left intact even when the workflow completes successfully. This can be
# used to inspect the site working directory for debugging purposes.
#
# Default: false
#

keepSiteDir=false

# number of time a job will be retried if it fails (giving a maximum of
# 1 + execution.retries attempts at execution)
#

executionRetries=0


# Enables/disables replication. Replication is used to deal with jobs sitting
# in batch queues for abnormally large amounts of time. If replication is enabled
# and certain conditions are met, Swift creates and submits replicas of jobs, and
# allows multiple instances of a job to compete.
#

replicationEnabled=false

# If replication is enabled, this value specifies the minimum time, in seconds,
# a job needs to be queued in a batch queue in order to be considered for
# replication
#

replicationMinQueueTime=60

# The maximum number of replicas that Swift should attempt.

replicationLimit=3

# Controls how Swift will communicate the result code of running user programs
# from workers to the submit side. In files mode, a file
# indicating success or failure will be created on the site shared filesystem.
# In provider mode, the execution provider job status will
# be used. Notably, GRAM2 does not return job statuses correctly, and so
# provider mode will not work with GRAM2. With other
# providers, it can be used to reduce the amount of filesystem access compared
# to files mode.
#
# statusMode=files

# Controls how swift will supply parameters to the remote wrapper script.
# 'args' mode will pass parameters on the command line
# 'files' mode will pass parameters through an additional input file
#
# valid values: args, files
# Default: files
#
# wrapperParameterMode=args

# Determines if Swift remote wrappers will be executed by specifying an
# absolute path, or a path relative to the job initial working directory
#
# valid values: absolute, relative
# wrapperInvocationMode=absolute

#
# Limits the number of concurrent iterations that each foreach statement
# can have at one time. This conserves memory for swift programs that
# have large numbers of iterations (which would otherwise all be executed
# in parallel).
#
# Default: 16384
#

maxForeachThreads=16384

# controls whether the log file will contain provenance information
# enabling this will increase the size of log files, sometimes
# significantly.

logProvenance=false

# The URL prefix used to access local files in wrapper
# staging mode. Full URLs are created by concatenating:
#	* the value of this property
#	* the current swift work directory (as an absolute path)
#	* the file in question (relative to the current work directory)
#
#wrapperStagingLocalServer=file://

# Files mapped by the concurrent mapper (i.e. when you don't
# explicitly specify a mapper) are deleted when they are not
# in use any more. This property can be used to prevent
# files mapped by the concurrent mapper from being deleted.
