DESCRIPTION
    TBD

OPTIONS
    -s <port>
        Starts the service on the specified port. If no port
        is specified, 9999 is used.

    -h | -help
        Displays this help message and exits. 

    -l | -load <file>
        specifies a file to be loaded on startup 

    -t | -target <target>
        Starts on the specified target. If missing, the
        default target (the Swing GUI) will be used

    -q | -quit
        Render the graph and quit. Useful with
        non-interactive targets.  This is the default when
        the -load option is used. In server mode, the
        program will wait for a graph first, render it and
        then quit.

    -r | -loop 
        In server mode loop and wait for updates, and render
        them, as opposed to quitting after the graph is
        received.

    -o | -options <options>]
        Pass additional options to various
        sub-components. The value must be quoted and has the
        form [property=value[, property=value[,...]]]. Take
        a look at etc/grapheditor.properties for a list of
        properties.
