(07/23/2009)

*** Added file:info()

(06/26/2008)

*** WeightedHostScoreScheduler behaviour changed for low scoring sites;
    low scoring sites have a delay between submissions, rather than the
    previous behaviour of always taking a load of at least 2.

(04/30/2008)

*** Added raceFor. It's a blend between race() and for(). It will 
    iterate in parallel until the first iteration completes.

(04/29/2008)

*** WeightHostScheduler initial score and load factor can now be set
    per host, by setting properties in the BoundHost object for each
    host: initialScore for the initial score (defaults to 0), and
    jobThrottle (defaults to the system-wide default value, set through
    other properties)

(03/15/2008)

*** The WeightedHost scheduler now has a lower bound (of -10)
    on scoring to reduce the effect of penalising a host in the case of a
    large number of transient errors. Previously, a large number of
    transient errors would push the score so low that the score would
    take far too long to return to a more appropriate value.

(02/22/2008)

*** Added sys:dateFormat(pattern, value)

(02/12/2008)

*** Added the maxSubmissionTime parameter to the score scheduler.
    It's not strictly enforced, but the submission time of a job
    submission task is now part of the feedback loop. The submission
    time contributes to the score linearly and in addition to the other
    things (such as successFactor). If the submission time
    is 0.5s, the contribution is 0. If the submission time of a job
    is exactly maxSubmissionTime, then the contribution is 
    -successFactor.

(02/11/2008)

*** Added some code to store stack frames of less than 5 elements
    in a less memory consuming structure that HashMap.

(10/03/2007)

*** Converted more things to use the CWD below

(09/19/2007)

*** Added hostCount argument to task:execute. This means that, in
    general, count should be understood to mean "process count"
    
*** Added batch argument to task:execute. It allows for 
    "fire and forget" jobs.

(09/13/2007)

*** Added a fixed rate submit queue. It can be enabled by specifying
    the maxSubmitRate property for a host. The value is a floating
    point number. So if you wanted at most one job submitted every
    ten seconds, the rate would be 0.1.

(09/06/2007)

*** Partial ability to have a CWD for each separate execution, 
    if done from the same JVM.

(08/28/2007)

*** "off" is now a valid value for throttling parameters

(08/23/2007)

*** Added task:availableHandlers(*type). In case people don't
    have to manually add handlers.

(08/22/2007)

*** failOnJobError=false would not make task:execute() return 
    anything if the job succeeded. Now it returns a 0.

(08/20/2007)

*** Added failOnJobError flag to task:execute(). Should it be set
    to false, it would prevent task:execute() from failing when 
    a non-zero exit code is detected from the application, and 
    return the exit code instead.
    
*** Added stdoutLocation and stderrLocation to task:execute().
    One can now put these two in either the stdout/stderr channels,
    local files, remote files, or any possible combination of these
    (assuming the providers support these).

(08/16/2007)

*** task:execute() would redirect the job stderr to stdout. Fixed.

*** Some space optimizations on commonly (read heavily) used types.

*** Global variables set to the Java "null" would be reported as
    not found. Fixed.
    
*** task:transfer now sets thirdPartyIfPossible to true by default
    when the third party argument is not specified. This means that
    third party transfers would be automatically attempted if possible,
    while falling back to simulating them if not. If one needs to force
    third party transfer to always off or always on, the thirdParty 
    argument would do the trick.
    
*** sys:readFile (or sys:file:read) would add extra newlines of their
    own for no good reason. Fixed.
    
*** sys:file:write used to flush the stream after every write. Not
    any more.
    
*** Fixed a bug in the scheduler which would cause it to endlessly
    wait for resources that weren't there to begin with before
    scheduling certain tasks.


(07/02/2007)

*** A few size/performance optimizations on argument related things

*** Closing of ordered channels is not done recursively any more. 
    For large parallelism, this could cause a stack overflow 
    (see http://bugzilla.mcs.anl.gov/swift/show_bug.cgi?id=72)

(04/11/2007)

*** Fixed global throttling of job submission

(03/11/2007)

*** Use a thread pool for submission instead of starting
    a new thread every time. The thread pool is a cached
	thread pool. It starts new threads as needed and shuts them
	down after a certain idle time.

(02/27/2007)

*** AllocateHost was leaking a few things in the schedulers.
    Fixed.

(02/14/2007)

*** Fixed some issues with comments not being parsed correctly

(02/05/2007)

*** Added file resource throttling

(01/21/2007)

*** [u]parallelFor didn't handle concurrent exceptions correctly.
    Fixed.

(01/18/2007)

*** Fixed exceptions in failing grid tasks

*** Fixed the cache family of functions to properly deal with
    exceptions

(01/06/2007)

*** Improvements to scheduler performance.

*** Some fixes to a problem with task events.

*** Fixed the weighted host scheduler locking up.

(12/30/2006)

*** Began simplifying the way karajan exceptions are implemented.

*** Added file:size()

*** generateError() has throw() as an alias, and choice() has 
    try() as an alias. choice() doesn't make much sense and will
	eventually be removed.
	
*** Added exception(message, prev). It can be used nicely with
    throw() to chain exceptions.
	
*** Updated exclusive(on=). Without the "on" argument, it defines
    a global mutual exclusion region (no other exclusive 
	block witout the "on" argument can be running concurrently).
	With the "on" argument specified, it will treat the value
	as defining a token that defines the exclusion criteria (i.e.
	no two exclusive blocks with the same value passed to the
	"on" argument can be executed concurrently)
	

************************** v0.35 ***************************

(12/28/2006)

*** Added a mechanism in the schedulers to distinguish between
    resources not being found because of permanently unsatisfiable
	constraints or temporary load conditions. The heuristics used
	before were broken.
	
*** Fixed a memory leak in the schedulers with constraints not 
    being removed after a task was done or failed.
	
*** Some cleanups in the schedulers.

************************** v0.34 ***************************

(12/13/2006)

*** Sped up the parser a little

(12/12/2006)

*** Fixed service to properly handle elements defined on the
    other side.
	
*** Cleaned up the xstream conversion exception a bit

*** Removed files belonging to the old Axis based service

(12/07/2006)

*** Schedulers fail now when no resources are available for a 
    task but no tasks are running. The guess is that suitable
	resources will never be available for the task. 
	The checking of such conditions should be done in a better
	way.

(12/05/2006)

*** Added support for the .kml extension. This is only intended
    to allow the loader to load files with the .kml extension
	and interpret them as containing XML Karajan scripts (so
	the contents is the same as that for .xml files)
	
*** Added DOTALL mode to str:matches()

*** Fixed the exit code to not be 0 if the execution fails

(11/30/2006)

*** Updated the adaptive scheduler

*** fixed allocateHost() to actually tell the scheduler when it 
    is done.

(11/24/2006)

*** Fixed sort() to not ignore descending= and to not convert
    values to strings before performing the sort.
	
*** Also fixed ignoreErrors to do DOTALL matching

(11/22/2006)

*** Added once(). It works like cacheOn(), but it is guaranteed
    (at the expense of no bounds on the memory)
	
*** Fixed the adaptive scheduler

*** Partially fixed cache/cacheOn to work better when things
    fail
	
*** Enabled DOTALL mode in restartOnError (note to self: do this
    for the rest of the regexp error handling things) such that
	"." will also match newline characters
	
*** A slightly better uid() which returns a more compact string

(11/06/2006)

*** Changed the way the virtual hosts work. Until now, the
	first task using a virtual host would bind it. The change
	consists in making allocateHost asynchronous by queuing a 
	special task when constraints are used. This achieves the
	same purpose as virtual hosts (i.e. push the allocation
	choice to the scheduler) but when constraints are used, the
	host "returned" by allocateHost is bound and not virtual 
	(i.e. you can print it out).
	
*** Added constraint checkers to the scheduler. They can be used
	to enforce various constraints on both the task and the
	resource when mathcing them (not unlike the Condor match maker).
	
*** Changed the schedulers to use constraint checkers.

*** Updated the way element definitions are stored internally.
	Previously a wasteful HashSet (backed by a HashMap) were
	used. Considering that namespace overloaded and overriden
	definitions are somewhat rare, this was a waste of space.
	It is hoped that the new way of doing things is more 
	conservative on memory at insignifficant losses (if any)
	in performance.

(10/24/2006)

*** An attempt at fixing a concurrency bug in the code
	that keeps returns of parallel() and parallelFor()
	in order.

(10/23/2006)

*** the fix on task:execute(arguments=...) broke passing
	arguments as a string. Hopefully it's fixed this time

(10/18/2006)

*** dir:make() now does a mkdirs() rather than mkdir()

(10/17/2006)

*** Added the possibility to share schedulers (if in the same JVM 
	instance) between executions.
	
*** Made sure the event bus is initialized in all cases

(10/16/2006)

*** Make task:execute(arguments=...) work with vargs

(10/14/2006)

*** Fixed some of the examples

*** Fixed missing true() and false() functions and typo in the
	viewer

*** Updated the viewer to treat assignments and echo() as atomic

(10/11/2006)

*** Added sys:unique(). It returns its arguments asynchronously, but
	each argument is returned only once
	
*** Changed the tasks to post an event instead of calling the caller
	directly. This is supposed to release shared notification threads
	faster to increase concurrency. However, measurements show little
	improvements.
	
*** Changed the way futures throw exceptions. Until now exceptions in 
	futures would cause the thread which started the future to 
	nondeterministically fail whenever the exception occured. That
	didn't sound right. In the new model attempting to use the value
	of a future would be the exact operation throwing the exception.
	Additionally, a future, if not used, would fail silently. 
	Furthermore, if a failure occurs in the future thread after the 
	value of a future is calculated, the value will be available and
	the failure will be ignored. The last part is somewhat questionable, 
	but likely necessary. Due to the way futures work, the exact scheduling
	of threads may create nondeterminism in the behaviour of things.
	Example:
	
		f := future(
			"I am a future value"
			generateError("I was destined for /dev/null")
		)
		
		print(f)
	
	In the above example, the program will finish successfully. If print(f)
	was to fail because of the error, it would largely depend on whether, 
	after the generation of the future value, print(f) or generateError(...)
	would be scheduled first. Instead of risking nondeterminism here, print(f)
	will always succeed because semantically it is correct. But this still
	leaves an error going unreported.
	

(10/05/2006)

*** Added str:quote() to put quotes around a string

(10/04/2006)

*** Added java:systemProperty which returns the value of a 
	Java system property.

(08/02/2006)

*** Fail if extra arguments are specified

*** Added some preliminary stat capability to the service

*** Also added a submit command to the service (to be used
    locally).
	
*** Added -nosec and -local arguments to the service.

*** RestartOnError can take a list of regexp as argument
    (this is somewhat reduntant, since the same goal can
	be achieved by the regexp itself, but it may provide
	for somewhat cleaner code)
	
*** Some cleanups.

(07/27/2006)

*** Added task:transferParams() which looks up in etc/bdp.conf (the
    same file as the one used by tgcp) to figure the GridFTP TCP
	buffer size
	
*** Added tcpBufferSize argument to task:transfer()

*** task:file:list() will list the files in the default directory if
    no argument is specified

(07/24/2006)

*** Reorganized and cleaned up code, in particular the bits dealing
    with element arguments

*** Added a throttling scheduler. It does not do scheduling, but it
    does throttling.
	
*** Added fault handlers to the scheduler
	
*** Added SSH throttling and restarting

*** Reorganized the service code a little

(07/12/2006)

*** Fixed task aborts

*** Added an experimental assignment operator: ':='. If there are multiple
    values on the right hand side, they need to be grouped under one element.

*** Allow "compact" blocks by not having to specify a sequential explicitly.
    Just the parentheses.

(07/11/2006)

*** Fixed a busy loop in the late binding scheduler

(07/08/2006)

*** Better stack traces. Only relevant things are now shown.

(07/07/2006)

*** Don't update/remove the channel list if a channel already existed

*** Corrected problems with stack unwinding on errors

*** Added support to store arbitrary strings in the log file

(06/26/2006)

*** Fixed a bug involving hosts without names

*** Fixed a problem with the lock release on the log file (rlog library)

*** Updated the viewer a little including some preliminary saving 
    capabilities

(06/21/2006)

*** Fixed a case sensitivity problem with arguments

*** Made stderr a commutative channel

*** Added multi-level submission throttling. It limits the number of 
    concurrent submissions that can happen at one time
	
*** The scheduler complains now if trying to set a property that is 
    unknown
	
*** Optimized access to channels


(06/20/2006)

*** Added ability to apply "task transformations" in the scheduler, after
    a task has been bound to a service
	
*** Added some code to allow specification of properties through their own
    channel, instead of as a list.
	
*** Fixed a problem with parallel iterators when a stack frame would be
    removed when it should not have been.
	
*** Removed cache argument in user defined elements. It was undocumented
    and the same functionality can be acheived using cache() or cacheOn()

*** Ability to add custom channels for stdout and stderr when embedding
    from Java

(05/10/2006)

*** Fixed a NPE when defining user elements. It was only visible if the 
    definition was done in sys.
	
*** Added fold(lambda, initial, ...). Similar to a feedback loop, it allows
    certain things to accumulate state over the values on a channel.

(04/25/2006)

*** Kernel elements are always defined globally. Due to the shallow definition
    lookup not having this was causing problems with the service.
	
*** Fixed a problem with the wrong thing being sent to the service

*** LinkedStack throws EmptyStackException instead of NPE if leave() is 
    called on an empty stack
	
*** Function collection invocations should not print warnings on exceptions.
    They can very well be things that are caught and handled properly.

(04/20/2006)

*** Updated the maybe test to also test for more than one child element

(04/19/2006)

*** Fixed a few problems with aborts:
	- If something wouldn't actually abort after being aborted
	the state manager would keep sending it abort events.
	- If an element would be aborted and then it will fail/complete
	it would do so with a messed up stack. The state manager now makes
	a copy of the stack when actually aborting something.
	
*** Fixed quoted list to not optimize things. It was broken.

*** Fixed maybe() to work properly if used with more than one child element

(04/18/2006)

*** Fixed wait() to abort properly

*** Fixed choice() to always have error defined

*** Fixed a problem with exports

*** Added partial support to task:transfer

*** str:chr() was incorrectly sys:chr() in sys-common

*** Fixed file:write() to convert objects to strings using TypeUtil. Arguably
    it should actually write binary data, or at least there should be some
	element that does. The problem was that Throwable.toString() does not
	return the stack trace.
	
*** Fixed a problem with optional arguments not being seen properly when 
    no mandatory arguments were present
	
*** Fixed a problem with the arguments to a user defined element were executed
    in the definition context. They should be executed in the calling context.
	
*** Imported files must now have their own imports, and they cannot use the
    ones from the importing context. Fixed the settings.* files in tests/ 
	accordingly
	
*** Fixed info() to print proper information about user defined elements

(04/12/2006)

*** Put back ... for the command line arguments. The cmdline:arguments global
    is still there
	
*** Some misc. cleanups

*** Added a few methods for tree manipulation (replaceElement, removeElement)

(04/10/2006)

*** changed sys:numberformat from (value, pattern) to (pattern, value)

(04/06/2006)

*** Added ExecutionContext.waitFor()

*** Moved ExecutionContext from karajan.stack to karajan.workflow

*** Made "executable" and "arguments" arguments to task:execute non-optional.
    They can be omitted, but the first two positional arguments map to them.
	
*** Added a KarajanWorkflow class

*** Changed kernel:export to export a set of immediately enclosed definitions
    if the other arguments are missing.
	
*** Added a "thirdparty" argument to task:transfer. Ideally the abstractions
    should figure out when a third party transfer can be done.

(03/31/2006)

*** A general code clean-up

*** Element definitions are now portable in the sense that
    the lookup for the elements inside the body of the definition
	is not done in the current scope but in the scope in which the
	definition was created. This makes things closer to lexical 
	scoping. On the other hand it still allows dynamic definitions
	that are different for different threads. Unfortunately, lookups
	are only performed once, since they are expensive, thus once bound
	an element keeps the same binding.
	
*** Added sys:each(list). It returns each element of the list (or
    something else that can be iterated) as individual values
	
*** Added list:get(list, index)

*** task:execute() shows better error message if both executable and
    specification are missing

*** Cleaned up the event handling in most elements. Low level things are
    not as visible. Instead of elements intercepting events, they now
	override methods like 'childCompleted'
	
*** Most heavily used collections now use adaptive sizing. For example
    the map with the properties for an element, instead of being initialized
	with the default size of 17 (or whatever it is), is now initialized with
	a size that reflects the average of the sizes of all property maps (for
	elements), which is closer to 2 or 3 (actually slightly higher than the
	average, and also corrected for the map load factor).
	
*** Removed some obsolete classes

*** Command line arguments are not available as ... in the main program. They
    are now instead accessible through the "cmdline:arguments" global (reminds
	me; those should be constants).
	
*** Changed the transliterator (the one that converts symbols to their internal
    forms in the parser) to not instantiate a new Character for each character 
	that is checked. Use a MutableCharacter instead.
	
*** No socket timeouts on persistent TCP channels

*** Some restructuring of the marshaling logic (elements are marshaled
    differently depending on whether they are part of source code or
	a reference on the stack). A policy is used now instead of a condition
	in the marshaler.
	
*** The state manager was initializing a timer even if checkpoints were
    disabled. Not any more.
	
*** Added channel:fork(count), and channel:close(channel). They (along with
    other things) allow Data Flow style programming.

*** Added sys:stats(). It returns information about memory usage, thread count,
    and number of CPUs. Especially useful to get statistics from services.
	
*** Added Condor DAGMan style restart logs (rlog library)

*** Added sys:self(). It allows recursive calls in lambdas without the 
    necessity to bind them to names. For completeness and because it's 
	just a few lines of code.
	
*** Added sys:exclusive(): lexical mutual exclusion.

*** In the service, if a comm channel has no contact information 
    (on how to re-establish the connection), it should not attempt
	to do so (a sure way to get a NPE).
	
*** Updated the HTML library to not export internally used elements

*** Updated CHANGES.txt ;)
	

(03/16/2006)

*** Added missing ProgressMonitoringEventType.java

(03/15/2006)

*** task:transfer now accepts srcprovider and destprovider if two 
    different providers are needed
	
*** made the transfer poll timer static (one per JVM instance) and
    re-enabled transfer progress events (if monitoring is enabled)

(01/03/2006)

*** If a function returns an array of primitives (say, char[]) return
    that as a single value instead of multiple
	
*** Added missing handling for -help in the loader

*** Added conversion from String to char[] in java invocations, thus
    fixing problems with passwordAuthentication and
	publicKeyAuthentication.
	
*** Updated gt4.xml

(12/23/2005)

*** Fixed a synchronization bug in the core event handling. It could
    cause lock-ups on SMP machines
	
*** Fixed the service to not send replies from the same threads that
    processes incoming requests. It was causing a "distributed deadlock"
	in which both server and client would block trying to flush the TCP
	output buffer, while not being able to process any requests.
	
*** Added a new stack (LinkedStack) which uses a linked list of frames
    but links to an existing stack for shared frames. It's more like a
	tree of frames, but with each 'stack' object seeing a different
	path to the root.
	
*** Rewrote the channel buffering/ordering logic to use less memory and
    be more efficient.
	
*** Rewrote the way "trust" is considered when the service is running in 
    shared mode. Local libraries are considered "trusted" code, therefore
	they can use restricted things.
	
*** Added missing -monitor command line flag. It pops a window that graphs
    various things over time (memory, threads, etc.)
	
*** Compress source of remote workflows when sending over to the service.

*** Added math:exp (e^x) and math:random()

*** Better error messages (some "smart" exception chain message extraction)

(11/23/2005)

*** Fixed a concurrency bug with return value ordering in parallel 
    elements. It looks like appendAll() was not properly implemented
	in the ordered vargs.

*** Fixed task:transfer to not require a provider. In this case it will
    use the first service of a host. It is still required if the host 
	is a string contact. Also fixed it to properly use/set security 
	contexts on used services
	
*** Some attempts at fixing the debugger

*** Always have ... defined in project()

(11/22/2005)

*** Use the argument parser in util.

*** Added info(), which can be used to get information about defined
	elements and their arguments
	
*** Added the -execute option to the loader. It can be used to pass a
    script as a string
	
*** Fixed an issue with the thread manager counting outside threads, 
    which caused problems if Karajan was started from Tomcat.
	
*** Command line arguments are passed in '...'


(11/09/2005)

*** Import/include now has a "export" argument which tells it to
	transparently export all definitions that it gets.
	
*** The meaning of "." in the library search path for import/include
	was changed to mean "the current directory of the currently executing
	file". That means that including "java.xml" from "task.xml" the latter 
	of which is in the class path, will not include the "java.xml" from the
	current directory, but rather the one from the class path.
	
*** Augmented channels with commutativity. When returning values
	on a commutative channel, the order does not need to be maintained.

(11/08/2005)

*** Added a catch element which can be used with choice to filter
    specific errors
	
*** Added guard(), something similar to try/finally. try blockA finally blockB (Java)
	would "translate" to guard(blockA, blockB)
	
*** Aborts are now handled like failures. This allows clean-up code to be used even
	if aborts occur.

(11/02/2005)

*** Fixed various problems with onError

(10/31/2005)

*** Fixed file operation tasks not having the proper number of required
    services.

(10/29/2005)

*** Updated tests since the hyphen is not a valid identifier character
    any more. 
	
*** Added the maybe element, which acts as a noop if an error occurs
    while executing its arguments.

(10/17/2005)

*** Added operators to the native syntax. The unfortunate side-effect
    to this is that hyphens cannot any more be used in identifiers.
	I suppose Karajan is stuck now with either Java naming conventions,
	or the C ones. Since the identifier syntax is shared between
	the native and XML versions, this applies to the XML syntax
	as well.
	
*** Removed the old service code. It was insecure, slow, and had little
    features.

*** Added an EXPERIMENTAL service, which can be used to submit remote scripts.
    It can be configured using regexps on host names to use persistent 
	connections, polling, callbacks, or a combination of these.

*** Added a restricted mode, which can be used to securely multiplex
    between multiple users. This is only used when the service is
	started in shared mode (a feature still in development). The
	unfortunate part is that access to certain things (such as 
	the Java library) is forbidden.

*** Changed they way libraries define elements. A library will now
    export definitions, using the export element, which simply returns
	a definition object on the default channel. The import element 
	(an alias to 'include') will bind all arguments on the default
	channel as definitions
	
*** Added a new core event system. It offers relatively the same
    performance as the old one, but the implementation is more
	'correct' (proper synchronization). It uses the concurrent
	libraries from Java 1.5 (a backport is provided, so it will
	also work with Java 1.4)

*** Added registers to the stack for storing frequently used data,
    thus removing the need for a hash table lookup. Performance measurements
	however show that this yields little overall improvement.
	
*** Split caching into two elements: cache and cacheOn. The former will
    cache lexically, while the latter will cache on a given reference.

*** Better distinction between static state and run-time state. It used
    to be that most statically, globally shared things would go into the
	the root node, which required the presence of the entire tree in 
	order to execute anything. Now, it has moved into an 'execution context', 
	which is accessible through the stack.
	
*** Added an EXPERIMENTAL option to the launcher to save the cache to the 
    disk, and automatically re-load it when the same file is executed again.
	
*** Other small bug-fixes and enhancements

(08/06/2005)

*** Added uParallel and uParallelFor (unbuffered versions) - returns are
    out of order
	
*** Fixed isDefined to take globals into consideration

*** Fixed isDefined case-sensitivity

*** Added 'macros'. Basically an element with the ability to control the
    evaluation of its arguments. The 'macro' simply receives its arguments
	as a list of lambdas. It is not technically a macro, since everything
	happens at run-time.
	
*** Added a define element. It binds a lambda to a name. I'm thinking that
    in the future the current way of defining elements be removed:
	instead of element(ident, args, body) it should be define(ident, element(args, body)).
	It allows the separation of the binding process from the particular definition, since
	there is more than one type of element definition. The associated code
	should be simpler, thus possibly less buggy. As a (nice) side effect, it
	allows more flexible manipulation of lambdas.

*** Changed parallel and parallelFor to have deterministic order 
    on the return values. This pretty much makes f(sequential(...)) 
	equivalent to f(parallel(...)) if ... are pure. The unbuffered
	versions are still there with a 'U' prefix, but they are not mapped
	in sys.
	
*** Updated the parser with better error messages in certain cases.

*** Fixed problem with user defined elements that didn't have lowercase
    arguments in the definition.
	
*** Added a force argument to dir:remove.

*** Schedulers are now configurable through the properties file

*** Batch scheduler projects can now be attached to a service instead
	of being specified with every job submission
	
*** Added an experimental adaptive scheduler

(05/14/2005)

*** Added a 'match' argument to restartOnError. Also added check in
    ignoreErrors to see if the match argument was evaluated properly.

(05/13/2005)

*** Fixed scheduler to not fail the task when resources are not 
    available (Bug #3346)
	
*** Added tests for execution both scheduled and unscheduled

(05/10/2005)

*** Fixed case sensitive set in XML. Changed expression parser
    to use IDENTIFIER() from the translator. Updated echo() to
	output to streams. Updated from print() to echo() in HTML 
	library.
	
*** Providers are now case-insensitive. 

*** Whenever the 'local' provider is used, the 'host' argument
    is not necessary for task:execute.

(05/08/2005)

*** The "If" construct works now without a condition node. The
    condition is now implied to be in the first element after the if.

*** Moved indispensable elements to the kernel: namespace. 

*** Moved the java elements out of sys and into java.

*** Added aliases to function collection classes, such the arguments
    and implementing method are described only once.

*** The arguments for the scheduler have proper names now instead of
    the figure-out-by type method.

*** Added argument checking to java:execute

*** Moved the stream argument from print() to echo(), so that print
    stays clean. An elemental ;) way should though be implemented for
    writing to streams (where there is no open/close).

(05/04/2005)

*** Added 'redirect' argument to task:execute. It will print the task
    output on the screen

(05/02/2005) 

*** Fixed future iterator synchronization.

*** Added a count for dynamically created event busses to -showstats

*** Various cleanups.

------------------ v 0.31 ------------------
(04/30/2005) 

*** Added new sort-of-lisp-like syntax

*** Formalized argument processing

*** Removed redundant for/foreach. Now it's only for

*** Changed parallel for from being an argument to a new element

*** Added futures for asynchronous results

*** Added parallel elements (which evaluate their arguments in
    parallel with their body)

*** Added the choice element (similar to try/catch)

*** Added the parallelChoice element (arbitrated race)

*** Added the concept of channels (named vargs), and their supporting
    elements

*** Added a print element. It uses channels (so it has functional
    behavior instead of the side-effect-style echo)

*** Rewrote the event classes to simplify them.

*** Switched to xstream (xstream.codehaus.org) for serialization
    /deserialization to/from XML. The state serialization and the
    source serialization are now done with the same
    library. Underneath it uses the xpp3 parser. Seems to be pretty
    fast.

*** Rewrote the event bus. It can now create threads on the fly if one
    bus is blocked processing another event (usually from badly
    behaved elements), and re-locate events to the newly created bus.

*** Added an experimental (and buggy) debugger.

*** Improved the checkpointing. it may not work if complex,
    unserializable objects are put on the stack).

*** Began adding File Operations from the CoG Abstractions.

*** Remove the forward arguments. Hard to program, hard to maintain,
    error prone.

*** Made some performance improvements (in general optimizations for
    certain common execution patterns)

*** Misc. maintenance things not worth mentioning
